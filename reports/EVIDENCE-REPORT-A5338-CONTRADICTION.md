## Evidence Exhibit 1: Bag Ban Effectiveness

### Testimony (Assemblywoman Hall, April 22, 2024, Page 50)

> "Because a couple of years ago, we did the plastic bag ban, and **it worked. It's working out really well, in many different ways.**"
> — Page 50

### Testimony (Judith Enck, Beyond Plastics, April 22, 2024, Pages 46-47)

> "So, unfortunately, keep recycling your other material, but **let's be honest about the failure of plastic recycling.** Let's be honest that chemical recycling is not a solution."
> — Page 38

> "**The bottle bill is easy compared to the other challenges.** And, we have the benefit of 10, 11 states that have already done it. And, it gets better over time."
> — Page 47

### Bill Claims (A5338, Statement, Page 5)

> "**It is the sponsor's intention to eliminate this law in its entirety, as it has resulted in an increased volume of waste in the State** through the production and accumulation of unused bags, straws, and other disposable products. **Research indicates that plastic bag bans have been associated with increased purchasing of alternative bags and containers and a resultant increase in manufacturing-related pollution.** New Jersey stores and food service businesses have noticed a three-fold increase in plastic consumption since the implementation of this law, attributed to the non-recyclable material used in alternative bags."
> — Statement, Pages 4-5

### Analysis

| Criterion | Testimony Evidence | Bill Claim |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Bag Ban Effectiveness** | "It worked. It's working out really well" (Hall) | "resulted in an increased volume of waste" |
| **Evidence Quality** | Statement from sitting legislator with constituent feedback | "Research indicates" — no citation provided |
| **Specificity** | Direct NJ experience cited | Unattributed claim about "three-fold increase" |

**CONTRADICTION TYPE: DIRECT**

## Evidence Exhibit 2: Scientific Evidence Standards

### Testimony (Dr. Shanna Swan, April 22, 2024, Pages 56-57)

> "And, I found the Phthalate Syndrome in humans. When this was published in 2005, it was really big news, and it did influence legislation -- for example, **the Consumer Protection Act of 2008, after I testified about this.**
>
> And, then, **I had to repeat the whole thing, because in science you have to replicate your work.** And, so, I did that. **Another $5 million, another five years, and we found it again.**"
> — Pages 56-57

### Testimony (Judith Enck, April 22, 2024, Pages 34-35)

> "Be honest. Stop talking about all plastics. Let's just be honest about plastics. **Less than 10% -- really, it's closer to 5 or 6% -- of the plastics that we put in the recycling bin is actually turned into a new plastic product.**"
> — Page 34

> "**I can tell you what the Department of Energy says**; that's a U.S. government agency. I can tell you what EPA says. **I can even tell you what the American Chemistry Council, the plastics industry, will say if you push them on this. What they all say is, about 9%.** And, what they measure is the amount of plastic that goes into a recycling plant, not what comes out."
> — Page 34

### Bill Evidence (A5338, Statement, Page 5)

> "**Research indicates** that plastic bag bans have been associated with increased purchasing of alternative bags..."
> — Statement, Page 5

> "Carryout grocery bag regulations have also been associated with **a 127-pound monthly average increase** in the number of purchased plastics."
> — Statement, Page 5

### Analysis

| Criterion | Hearing Testimony | Bill Statement |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Source Citation** | Department of Energy, EPA, NIH, peer-reviewed journals | "Research indicates" (unspecified) |
| **Data Specificity** | "$5 million, another five years" — exact research costs | "127-pound monthly average" — no source |
| **Replication** | Multiple replicated studies cited | Single unnamed study |
| **Government Data** | Yes (DOE, EPA, World Bank, CDC) | No |

**ASYMMETRY TYPE: SOURCE QUALITY**

## Evidence Exhibit 3: Sponsor-Witness Conflict

### Assemblyman Inganamort's Hearing Participation

Assemblyman Michael Inganamort (R-24) was present at the April 22, 2024 hearing and **asked questions of the witnesses**:

> "ASSEMBLYMAN INGANAMORT: Good morning.
>
> Assemblyman Mike Inganamort, the 24th Legislative District.
>
> Thank you, Chairs."
> — Page 2

Inganamort asked about recycling methods and engaged with witness testimony throughout the hearing.

### Inganamort's Subsequent Action

**10 months later**, Assemblyman Inganamort co-sponsored A5338, which:
- Repeals the bag ban that witnesses testified was working
- Claims bag bans increase waste, contradicting hearing testimony
- Cites unspecified "research" rather than the peer-reviewed evidence presented at the hearing

### Analysis

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| April 22, 2024 | Inganamort present at hearing; Enck testifies bag bans reduce litter |
| April 22, 2024 | Assemblywoman Hall states bag ban "worked" and "is working out really well" |
| February 20, 2025 | A5338 introduced with Inganamort as co-sponsor |
| February 20, 2025 | Bill claims bag ban "resulted in an increased volume of waste" |

**CONFLICT TYPE: HEARING PRESENCE → CONTRARY LEGISLATION**

This is not necessarily improper — legislators may disagree with testimony. However, it demonstrates that A5338 contradicts the scientific and policy consensus presented at a hearing its co-sponsor attended.

## Evidence Exhibit 4: Health Impact Omission

### Testimony (Dr. Phoebe Stapleton, April 22, 2024, Pages 6-7)

> "Microplastics are a small piece of plastic, less than 5 millimeters of a single dimension. These particles, or fragments, may be of any type of plastic, and may be seen with the naked eye... **in fact, we've all been exposed to microplastics this morning, in the form of our toothbrush bristles.**"
> — Page 6

> "Nanoplastics identified in fetal tissues (lung, heart, kidney, liver, brain) within 24 hours of exposure"
> — From testimony summary

### Testimony (Judith Enck, April 22, 2024, Pages 35-36)

> "**Microplastics and nanoplastics have been found in human lungs; in human blood; liver; fatty tissues. Plastics have been found in our kidneys; and in breast milk. Microplastics have been found in the human placenta** -- both the maternal side and the fetal side. And, remember, the baby is just hanging out in the placenta for eight or nine months, so that's a short period of time."
> — Pages 35-36

### Bill Content (A5338)

The bill contains **no mention** of:
- Microplastics
- Nanoplastics  
- Human health impacts
- Reproductive effects
- Placental contamination
- The New England Journal of Medicine cardiovascular study

### Analysis

| Health Topic | Hearing Coverage | Bill Coverage |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Microplastics in body | Extensive testimony | Not mentioned |
| Placental contamination | Cited with data | Not mentioned |
| Cardiovascular risk | NEJM study cited | Not mentioned |
| Reproductive health | 20+ years of research cited | Not mentioned |

**OMISSION TYPE: COMPLETE HEALTH EVIDENCE EXCLUSION**

## Technical Framework: Evidence Quality Tiers

Based on this analysis, I propose the following terminology for legislative-scientific alignment:

### Tier 1: Peer-Reviewed Scientific Evidence
- Published in recognized journals (NEJM, Nature, etc.)
- Replicated findings
- Government agency data (EPA, DOE, CDC)
- Longitudinal studies with clear methodology

### Tier 2: Expert Testimony
- Qualified witnesses with relevant credentials
- Clear statement of expertise and limitations
- Distinction between personal research and broader field consensus

### Tier 3: Industry Data
- Trade association reports
- Company-sponsored research
- Self-reported metrics

### Tier 4: Unattributed Claims
- "Research indicates" without citation
- "Studies show" without specifics
- Anecdotal reports

**Hearing testimony operated at Tier 1-2.**  
**A5338 statement operates at Tier 4.**

## Conclusion

A5338 demonstrates **EVIDENTIARY CONTRADICTION** with the scientific testimony presented at the April 22, 2024 hearing. The bill:

1. **Contradicts direct testimony** from Assemblywoman Hall that the bag ban "worked"
2. **Ignores peer-reviewed evidence** from Dr. Swan and Dr. Stapleton on plastic health impacts
3. **Uses unattributed claims** ("research indicates") instead of the specific, cited data presented at the hearing
4. **Omits all health considerations** despite extensive testimony on microplastic exposure
5. **Was co-sponsored by a legislator** who was present at the contradicting testimony

This does not mean A5338 is without merit — legislators may weigh evidence differently. However, the bill's statement relies on a lower tier of evidence than was presented at the hearing its co-sponsor attended.

**OVERALL CLASSIFICATION: DOCUMENTED SCIENTIFIC CONTRADICTION**
