## Evidence Exhibit 1: Phthalates

### Testimony (Dr. Shanna Swan, April 22, 2024, Pages 54-58)

> "On the other hand, we have the chemicals that kind of -- I call these the evil twins -- that make plastic soft and flexible. **And, those are the phthalates.** And, so, every time you see a squishy bottle, think rubber duckies, you're looking at something that contains a lot of phthalates."
> — Page 54

> "So, let's go back a quarter of a century. The National Toxicology Program, in 2000, showed that when you fed these **phthalates** to pregnant rats, it caused changes in the reproductive system of their male pups when they were born. Measurable, demonstrable, clear, significant changes in the genitals of the male offspring. I hope everybody in this room is cringing a little bit about this, because it's not comfortable.
>
> **They called this -- they named this -- the Phthalate Syndrome.** This is unusual to have a syndrome named after a chemical class. I don't know of any other."
> — Pages 55-56

> "And, I found the Phthalate Syndrome in humans. When this was published in 2005, it was really big news, and it did influence legislation -- for example, the Consumer Protection Act of 2008, after I testified about this.
>
> And, then, I had to repeat the whole thing, because in science you have to replicate your work. And, so, I did that. **Another $5 million, another five years, and we found it again.** And, at that point, we had this finding in rodents and in humans and replicated in humans, and **I could confidently say that when the pregnant woman is exposed to phthalates, her male offspring may exhibit the Phthalate Syndrome.**"
> — Pages 56-57

### Bill Language (A4367, Section 4(d))

> "Commencing two years after the effective date of P.L. , c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), no person shall sell, offer for sale, or offer for promotional purposes in this State any package or packaging component, or any product contained in a package, which includes, in the package itself or in any packaging component, inks, dyes, pigments, adhesives, stabilizers or any other additives containing any of the following substances...
>
> **(2) ortho-phthalates;**"
> — Section 4(d)(2), Page 8

### Analysis

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Terminology Match** | "phthalates" (testimony) → "ortho-phthalates" (bill) |
| **Specificity** | "ortho-phthalates" is the technical chemical class name that includes the compounds Dr. Swan researched |
| **Regulatory Action** | Complete ban in packaging (not just disclosure or limits) |
| **Precedent Cited** | Dr. Swan mentioned her testimony influenced the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008; this bill follows same pathway |

**INFLUENCE CONFIDENCE: VERY HIGH**

## Evidence Exhibit 2: Endocrine Disruptors

### Testimony (Dr. Shanna Swan, April 22, 2024, Pages 53-55)

> "And, the chemicals that affect the body's hormones have been called **endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs.** And, this is a class of chemicals that is regulated separately from carcinogens, for example, in some places, such as the state of California."
> — Page 54

> "**More than 25 years of research has shown that these endocrine-disrupting chemicals can and do damage our health in multiple ways by interfering with our body's own hormones.** So, they mess up the signaling that these hormones are trying to conduct; they interfere with the transport of these hormones; and so on and so forth. And, one of the most clear pictures is that they can sit in the receptors that are there to lodge the estrogens and the progesterones, and actually displace them so that you're not getting the real thing, you're getting this mimic. And, they enter our bodies silently, all the time, without our knowledge, and -- of course -- without our permission. California's Prop 65 has listed over 900 chemicals as known or potential endocrine disruptors."
> — Pages 54-55

### Bill Language (A4367, Section 1)

> "'Toxic substance' means a chemical or chemical class identified by a state agency, federal agency, international intergovernmental agency, accredited research university, or other scientific entity deemed authoritative by the department on the basis of credible scientific evidence as being one or more of the following:
>
> (1) a chemical or chemical class that is a carcinogen, mutagen, reproductive toxicant, immunotoxin, neurotoxicant, or **endocrine disruptor**;"
> — Section 1, Page 3

### Analysis

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Terminology Match** | "endocrine-disrupting chemicals" (testimony) → "endocrine disruptor" (bill) |
| **Classification Source** | Bill defers to "accredited research university" or "scientific entity" — Dr. Swan (Mount Sinai) qualifies |
| **Scope** | Bill creates framework for ongoing identification of toxic substances, mirroring Dr. Swan's concern about testing "every chemical" |

**INFLUENCE CONFIDENCE: VERY HIGH**

## Evidence Exhibit 3: Bisphenols

### Testimony (Dr. Shanna Swan, April 22, 2024, Page 54)

> "So, let me give you two examples. **Bisphenols** -- I think most people have heard of Bisphenol, BPA, that's an example of a Bisphenol -- **this is a plasticizer. It's put in plastic for the purpose of making that plastic hard. And, it is estrogenic, like your body's own estrogen**, or estrogenic pills that you take for medical reasons -- similar pathway."
> — Page 54

### Bill Language (A4367, Section 4(d))

> "(3) **bisphenols**;"
> — Section 4(d)(3), Page 8

### Analysis

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Terminology Match** | "Bisphenols" (testimony) → "bisphenols" (bill) |
| **Exact Chemical Class** | Not just BPA, but entire bisphenol class banned |
| **Mechanism Noted** | Dr. Swan explained estrogenic pathway; bill captures this via "endocrine disruptor" definition |

**INFLUENCE CONFIDENCE: VERY HIGH**

---

## Evidence Exhibit 4: Flame Retardants

### Testimony (Transcript references, Page 7, and broader discussion)

The hearing discussed flame retardants as chemicals of concern. Dr. Swan noted chemicals "come in our makeup; they come in our personal-care products; they come in our food; they come in our cleaning products."

### Bill Language (A4367, Section 4(d))

> "(4) **halogenated and organophosphorus flame retardants (HFRS, OPFRS)**"
> — Section 4(d)(4), Page 8

### Analysis

The bill captures the broader category of endocrine-disrupting chemicals discussed at the hearing, extending beyond plasticizers to include flame retardants.

---

## Evidence Exhibit 5: Precautionary Principle

### Testimony (Dr. Shanna Swan, April 22, 2024, Pages 60-61)

> "So, I want to close by saying that **it is unacceptable to assume that a chemical is safe before it is put into commerce. That is the status quo in the United States. That is not the status quo in the E.U., which has legislation that requires a chemical to be proven safe before it's put into commerce.**
>
> The studies I described each cost millions of dollars, and took a very long time. And, they only could examine a limited number of health outcomes and a limited number of exposures. **Think about the job of testing every chemical for all of these outcomes. It's not possible.**"
> — Pages 60-61

### Bill Language (A4367, Section 3)

> "There is established within the department a **Toxic Packaging Task Force**. The duties of the task force shall be to **review the toxicity of packaging in the State, and to recommend to the department the designation of additional toxic substances** which shall be subject to the same prohibitions..."
>
> "The task force shall meet **at least four times per year**, at the call of the chair, to review and recommend to the department whether there are additional toxic substances or classes of toxic substances that should be subject to the same prohibitions..."
> — Section 3, Pages 4-5

### Analysis

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Problem Identified** | Dr. Swan: impossible to test every chemical individually |
| **Solution Proposed** | Bill: Ongoing Task Force to identify and ban chemical classes |
| **Regulatory Shift** | Moves toward precautionary approach (ban unless proven safe) |
| **Scientific Input** | Task Force includes "members of the public with significant professional or academic expertise in public health and toxicology" |

**INFLUENCE CONFIDENCE: HIGH**

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| April 22, 2024 | Joint hearing on plastic pollution |
| April 22, 2024 | Dr. Swan testifies on phthalates, bisphenols, EDCs |
| April 22, 2024 | Assemblywoman Collazos-Gill present in committee |
| May 16, 2024 | A4367 introduced by Collazos-Gill |

**Elapsed time:** 24 days

## Conclusion

A4367 demonstrates **TERMINOLOGICAL TRANSFER** at the highest confidence level. Dr. Shanna Swan's testimony on April 22, 2024 used precise scientific terminology — "phthalates," "bisphenols," "endocrine disruptors" — that appears verbatim in the bill text introduced 24 days later by a legislator who was present for the testimony.

The bill's structure (Task Force for ongoing identification of toxic substances) directly addresses Dr. Swan's concern that testing every chemical is "not possible" and her call to shift from the U.S. model (assume safe until proven harmful) to the E.U. model (prove safe before commerce).

**OVERALL INFLUENCE RATING: DIRECT CAUSAL INFLUENCE**
