# Legislative-Scientific Influence Analysis: Technical Terminology Framework

## Purpose

This document establishes a standardized vocabulary for analyzing the relationship between scientific testimony in legislative hearings and subsequent bill language. These terms enable precise, reproducible assessment of influence pathways.

---

## Part I: Influence Classification Types

### 1. TERMINOLOGICAL TRANSFER
**Definition:** Scientific or technical terminology from testimony appears verbatim or near-verbatim in bill language.

**Indicators:**
- Exact chemical names (e.g., "ortho-phthalates")
- Technical category names (e.g., "endocrine disruptor")
- Specific numerical thresholds from testimony
- Professional role categories matching testimony recommendations

**Confidence Level:** HIGHEST — Difficult to attribute to coincidence

**Example:**
> Testimony: "And, those are the phthalates."
> Bill: "(2) ortho-phthalates;"

---

### 2. SUBSTANTIVE ALIGNMENT
**Definition:** Bill provisions address the same concerns, mechanisms, or policy approaches discussed in testimony, without verbatim terminology.

**Indicators:**
- Problem-solution matching
- Regulatory mechanism similarity
- Target population alignment
- Enforcement approach consistency

**Confidence Level:** HIGH — Requires demonstration of problem-solution correspondence

**Example:**
> Testimony: "Think about the job of testing every chemical... It's not possible."
> Bill: Creates ongoing Task Force to identify and ban chemical classes over time

---

### 3. TEMPORAL CAUSATION
**Definition:** Clear timeline demonstrating bill introduction followed testimony by a reasonable drafting period.

**Indicators:**
- Bill introduced within 30-90 days of hearing
- No prior version of bill before hearing
- Sponsor referenced hearing in floor remarks

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE — Correlation, not proof of causation

---

### 4. SPONSOR PRESENCE
**Definition:** Bill sponsor was documented as present at hearing where relevant testimony was given.

**Indicators:**
- Name appears in hearing attendance record
- Asked questions of relevant witnesses
- Made statements during Q&A

**Confidence Level:** SUPPORTING — Strengthens other influence indicators

---

### 5. EVIDENTIARY CONTRADICTION
**Definition:** Bill claims or provisions directly oppose scientific evidence presented at hearing.

**Indicators:**
- Opposite factual claims
- Rejection of peer-reviewed findings
- Omission of health or safety data from hearing

**Confidence Level:** DEFINITIVE — Clear divergence is documentable

---

### 6. SOURCE ASYMMETRY
**Definition:** Bill relies on lower-quality evidence sources than testimony presented at hearing.

**Indicators:**
- "Research indicates" without citation vs. named peer-reviewed studies
- Industry-funded claims vs. government data
- Anecdotal reports vs. replicated scientific findings

**Confidence Level:** HIGH — Quality differential is measurable

---

## Part II: Evidence Quality Tiers

### Tier 1: Gold Standard Evidence
- Peer-reviewed journal publications (NEJM, Nature, Science, etc.)
- Replicated findings (multiple independent studies)
- Government agency official data (EPA, CDC, NOAA, DOE)
- Longitudinal studies with published methodology
- Meta-analyses

### Tier 2: Expert Testimony
- Qualified witnesses with demonstrated credentials
- Personal research (pre-replication)
- Professional organization consensus statements
- Academic institution reports

### Tier 3: Industry and Advocacy Data
- Trade association reports
- Company-sponsored research
- Advocacy organization publications
- Self-reported industry metrics

### Tier 4: Unattributed Claims
- "Research indicates" without citation
- "Studies show" without specifics
- "Experts say" without naming experts
- Anecdotal reports

---

## Part III: Influence Pathway Mapping

### Direct Pathway
```
Scientific Testimony → [Terminological Transfer] → Bill Language
```
Evidence required: Verbatim or near-verbatim terminology match

### Indirect Pathway
```
Scientific Testimony → [Substantive Alignment] → Bill Provisions
```
Evidence required: Problem-solution correspondence demonstration

### Sponsor-Mediated Pathway
```
Scientific Testimony → [Sponsor Presence] → [Drafting Period] → Bill Introduction
```
Evidence required: Attendance documentation + temporal sequence

### Contradiction Pathway
```
Scientific Testimony ← [Evidentiary Contradiction] ← Bill Claims
```
Evidence required: Documented factual opposition

---

## Part IV: Confidence Rating Scale

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **DEFINITIVE** | Terminological transfer + sponsor presence + temporal causation |
| **VERY HIGH** | Terminological transfer + substantive alignment |
| **HIGH** | Substantive alignment + temporal causation |
| **MODERATE** | Substantive alignment alone OR temporal causation + sponsor presence |
| **SUGGESTIVE** | Thematic similarity without specific terminology match |
| **CONTRADICTORY** | Evidentiary contradiction documented |

---

## Part V: Documentation Standards

### Required Elements for Influence Reports

1. **Testimony Citation**
   - Speaker name and credentials
   - Hearing date and page number
   - Verbatim quote with context

2. **Bill Citation**
   - Bill number and title
   - Section and page reference
   - Verbatim legislative text

3. **Influence Classification**
   - Type(s) from taxonomy above
   - Confidence rating with justification

4. **Sponsor Analysis**
   - Presence at hearing (yes/no with page reference)
   - Questions asked of relevant witnesses
   - Time between hearing and bill introduction

5. **Evidence Quality Assessment**
   - Tier classification for testimony evidence
   - Tier classification for any bill-cited evidence
   - Source asymmetry analysis if applicable

---

## Part VI: Application Examples

### Example 1: A4367 (Toxic Packaging Reduction Act)

| Element | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Influence Types | Terminological Transfer, Substantive Alignment, Sponsor Presence |
| Confidence Rating | DEFINITIVE |
| Key Terminology | "ortho-phthalates," "bisphenols," "endocrine disruptor" |
| Sponsor Presence | Yes (Assemblywoman Collazos-Gill, Page 6) |
| Temporal Gap | 24 days (April 22 → May 16, 2024) |

### Example 2: A5338 (Bag Ban Repeal)

| Element | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Influence Types | Evidentiary Contradiction, Source Asymmetry |
| Confidence Rating | CONTRADICTORY |
| Contradiction Point | Bill claims ban increased waste; testimony stated "it worked" |
| Source Asymmetry | Testimony: EPA, DOE data; Bill: "Research indicates" (no citation) |
| Sponsor Presence | Co-sponsor Inganamort present at hearing (Page 2) |

## Part VII: Future Development

This framework should be extended to include:

1. **Quantitative Metrics**
   - Terminology overlap percentage
   - Temporal causation probability models
   - Cross-hearing consistency scoring

2. **Visualization Tools**
   - Influence pathway diagrams
   - Timeline mapping
   - Terminology transfer heat maps

3. **Database Integration**
   - Structured storage of testimony-bill links
   - Query capability for pattern identification
   - Cross-session analysis
