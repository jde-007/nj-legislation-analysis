# Cross-Reference: Scientific Testimony → Bill Language

## Summary

This analysis traces direct connections between scientific testimony in NJ legislative hearings and the actual language of related bills. It identifies cases where testimony appears to have **directly influenced** bill drafting, as well as bills that **contradict** the scientific evidence presented.

---

## Part I: Direct Influence — Plastic Pollution Hearing (April 22, 2024)

### 1. A4367 (Toxic Packaging Reduction Act) — **STRONG INFLUENCE**

**Sponsor Connection:** Assemblywoman Alixon Collazos-Gill (lead sponsor) **was present at the hearing** as a committee member.

#### Dr. Shanna Swan's Testimony → Bill Language

| Testimony (April 22, 2024) | Bill A4367 Language | Assessment |
|---------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| "Phthalate Syndrome" — discovered and named by Dr. Swan | Section 4(d)(2): bans **"ortho-phthalates"** | **DIRECT MATCH** |
| "endocrine-disrupting chemicals" terminology | Section 1: defines toxic substance to include **"endocrine disruptor"** | **DIRECT MATCH** |
| Bisphenols mentioned as chemicals of concern | Section 4(d)(3): bans **"bisphenols"** | **DIRECT MATCH** |
| Flame retardants discussed as problematic | Section 4(d)(4): bans **"halogenated and organophosphorus flame retardants"** | **DIRECT MATCH** |
| "15,000+ chemicals used in plastic manufacturing" | Section 3: Creates **Toxic Packaging Task Force** to identify and restrict additional toxic substances | ALIGNED |
| "EU requires chemicals be proven safe before commerce" | Section 3(e): DEP must implement Task Force recommendations within 1 year | ALIGNED (precautionary approach) |

**Confidence Level: VERY HIGH** — Dr. Swan's exact chemical classes (phthalates, bisphenols, endocrine disruptors) appear in bill language. Her testimony on the research-to-policy pathway for the 2008 CPSIA may have served as a template.

#### Judith Enck's Testimony → Bill Language

| Testimony | Bill A4367 Language | Assessment |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| "Fuel efficiency analogy" for packaging standards | Section 2: Mandates 10% reduction every 2 years (50% by year 10) | ALIGNED |
| Less than 10% of plastics recycled | Section 1: "Recycling" explicitly excludes chemical recycling, incineration, pyrolysis | ALIGNED |
| EPR/Producer responsibility emphasis | Section 2: Places obligations on "producers" to reduce covered material | ALIGNED |

---

### 2. A1481 (Microplastics in Drinking Water) — **MODERATE INFLUENCE**

#### Dr. Phoebe Stapleton's Testimony → Bill Language

| Testimony | Bill A1481 Language | Assessment |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| Hundreds of thousands of nanoplastics in bottled water (Columbia/Rutgers research) | Section 2: Requires DEP to establish definition and testing methodology for microplastics in drinking water | ALIGNED |
| Emphasized need for "Federal and State support" for research | Section 4(c)(6): Evaluates "university involvement" and incentives for research | ALIGNED |
| Called for consultation with "toxicologists, public health experts" | Section 4(c)(2): Explicitly requires consultation with "marine biologists, oceanographers, water quality specialists, environmental scientists, toxicologists, public health experts" | **DIRECT MATCH** |
| 100% of Hawaii placental samples contained microplastics | Section 4(a)(1): Study must evaluate "short-term and long-term impacts of microplastics on human health" | ALIGNED |
| Cited Rutgers studies on NJ rivers | Section 4(c)(1): Stakeholder engagement must include NJ-based professionals | ALIGNED |

**Confidence Level: MODERATE** — The bill addresses concerns raised by Dr. Stapleton, though it was pre-filed before the hearing. The hearing may have strengthened legislative support.

## Part II: Contradictions — Bills That Oppose Scientific Testimony

### A5338 (Bag Ban Repeal) — **DIRECT CONTRADICTION**

**Sponsor Connection:** Co-sponsor Assemblyman Michael Inganamort **was present at the hearing** and asked questions of witnesses.

#### Scientific Testimony vs. Bill Claims

| Testimony (April 22, 2024) | A5338 Claims | Assessment |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Enck: "Recycling is real—except for plastics" | Claims "increased volume of waste" from bag ban | **CONTRADICTS** |
| Enck: Praised NJ bag ban as "behavior-change model" | Calls ban counterproductive | **CONTRADICTS** |
| Dr. Stapleton: Microplastics in all environments | No mention of microplastic reduction benefits | **IGNORES** |
| Dr. Swan: Plastic chemicals harm reproductive health | No mention of health impacts | **IGNORES** |
| Enck: Bottle bill states have 77% aluminum recycling vs 36% | Cites "research" claiming 127-lb monthly plastic increase | **QUESTIONABLE SOURCE** |

**Note:** The bill's statement claims "research indicates" bag bans increase pollution, but cites no specific peer-reviewed studies. This directly contradicts the peer-reviewed and government data presented at the hearing.

**The bill's co-sponsor was present for testimony stating the opposite position.** This represents a clear case of legislative disagreement with scientific consensus presented at the hearing.

## Part III: Direct Influence — Climate Resiliency Hearing (August 1, 2024)

### A2104 (Flood Mitigation Priority) — **MODERATE INFLUENCE**

#### Testimony → Bill Language Connections

| Testimony | Bill A2104 Language | Assessment |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| Lt. Amin: "Blue Acres has obtained more than $1.1 billion in Federal funding since Hurricane Sandy" | Section 1(c): Prioritizes "Blue Acres projects" for funding | ALIGNED |
| Lt. Amin: "1,100+ buyouts" via Blue Acres | Bill explicitly supports flood-prone land acquisition | ALIGNED |
| Dr. Herrington: "$1.3 billion in avoided damages" from beach nourishment | Section 2: Prioritizes "projects that include, or allow for, a flood mitigation project" | ALIGNED |
| Angarone: "30% of Ida claims outside FEMA flood zones" | Bill addresses infrastructure resilience beyond traditional flood zones | ALIGNED |
| Dr. Broccoli: "more climate change in the pipeline" — adaptation necessary | Bill focuses on adaptation/mitigation infrastructure | ALIGNED |

**Note:** A2104 was pre-filed before the hearing, but the hearing testimony strongly reinforces its rationale. The bill's sponsor, Assemblyman James J. Kennedy, chaired the Assembly committee at the hearing.

## Part IV: Bill-Testimony Alignment Summary

### Strong Alignment (Testimony Likely Influenced Bill)

| Bill | Key Scientist | Specific Evidence |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| A4367 | Dr. Shanna Swan | Phthalates, bisphenols, endocrine disruptors named in bill |
| A4367 | Judith Enck | Producer responsibility, reduction targets |

### Moderate Alignment (Testimony Supports Bill Intent)

| Bill | Key Witnesses | Evidence |
|------|--------------|----------|
| A1481 | Dr. Phoebe Stapleton | Stakeholder consultation language matches testimony |
| A2104 | Lt. Amin, Dr. Herrington | Blue Acres expansion, flood mitigation priority |

### Direct Contradiction

| Bill | Contradicted Testimony | Evidence |
|------|----------------------|----------|
| A5338 | Judith Enck, Dr. Swan, Dr. Stapleton | Claims bag ban increased waste; sponsors were at hearing |

---

## Part V: Key Findings

### 1. Sponsor Presence Matters

When legislators are present for testimony, it shows in their legislation:
- **Collazos-Gill** (at hearing) → Sponsored A4367 with Dr. Swan's exact chemical terminology
- **Kennedy** (chaired hearing) → Sponsored A2104 aligned with flood testimony
- **Inganamort** (at hearing) → Co-sponsored A5338 that contradicts testimony (demonstrating that presence doesn't guarantee agreement)

### 2. Scientific Terminology Transfer

The most striking evidence of influence is when **exact scientific terms** appear in legislation:
- "ortho-phthalates" — scientific term from Dr. Swan's research
- "endocrine disruptor" — Dr. Swan's field of expertise
- "marine biologists, oceanographers, toxicologists" — mirrors Dr. Stapleton's call for expertise

### 3. Evidence Quality Contested

A5338 cites "research" without peer-reviewed sources. The scientific witnesses at the hearing provided:
- Peer-reviewed publications (NEJM, Nature Climate Change)
- Government data (EPA, DEP, NOAA)
- Longitudinal studies (38 years of beach profiles, 100+ years of tide gauges)

The contrast between evidence standards is stark.
