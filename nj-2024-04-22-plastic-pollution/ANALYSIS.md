## Executive Summary

On April 22, 2024, the New Jersey Senate Environment and Energy Committee and Assembly Environment, Natural Resources, and Solid Waste Committee held a joint hearing on plastic pollution. This analysis examines how scientific experts engaged with legislators, the quality and impact of their testimony, and the legislative outcomes that emerged.

**Key Finding:** Scientific testimony was most effective when it combined rigorous peer-reviewed research with human health narratives that resonated with legislators' concerns about their constituents.

## Part II: Scientific Witnesses and Their Testimony

### Dr. Phoebe Stapleton, Ph.D.

**Position:** Associate Professor, Rutgers University Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy  
**Department:** Pharmacology and Toxicology  
**Expertise:** Micro/nanoplastics, particle inhalation during pregnancy, maternal-fetal health impacts

#### Key Scientific Claims

| Claim | Evidence Type | Strength |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 9.2 billion tons of plastic produced 1950-2017 | UN Environment Program data | Strong |
| 100% of Hawaii placental samples in 2021 contained microplastics (up from 60% in 2006) | Peer-reviewed longitudinal study | Strong |
| Hundreds of thousands of nanoplastic particles found in bottled water | Own research with Columbia University | Strong |
| Nanoplastics identified in fetal tissues within 24 hours of exposure | Laboratory research (rodent models) | Strong |
| March 2024 NEJM study: micro/nanoplastics in carotid plaque correlated with increased cardiovascular risk | New England Journal of Medicine | Strong |
| Indoor air can have microplastic concentrations 100x greater than outdoor | Published research | Moderate |

#### Effective Communication Strategies

1. **Relatable scale:** Compared microplastics to "sesame seeds" and noted everyone is exposed through toothbrush bristles
2. **Local relevance:** Cited Rutgers studies on Raritan and Passaic rivers in NJ
3. **Visual aids:** Provided printed figures showing placenta contamination trends
4. **Policy hook:** Concluded with call for "Federal and State support" to fund research

### Dr. Shanna H. Swan, Ph.D.

**Position:** Professor, Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  
**Expertise:** Reproductive epidemiology, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, phthalates, fertility decline

#### Key Scientific Claims

| Claim | Evidence Type | Strength |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 15,000+ chemicals used in plastic manufacturing; 25% classified as "chemicals of concern" | Meta-analysis | Strong |
| Discovered and replicated "Phthalate Syndrome" in humans (2005, confirmed) | NIH-funded research ($10M total) | Strong |
| Research influenced Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 | Congressional testimony | Strong |
| Worldwide sperm counts declined 50% since 1970 (~1%/year) | 2017 meta-analysis | Strong |
| 2023 update showed sperm count decline is accelerating | 2023 published update | Strong |
| Total fertility rate declining at same 1%/year rate globally | World Bank data | Strong |

#### Effective Communication Strategies

1. **Personal narrative:** Described the 10-15 year research journey, grant writing, replication studies
2. **Cost transparency:** "$5 million, another five years" to replicate findings
3. **Species-level framing:** Extended beyond human fertility to endangered species
4. **Regulatory contrast:** Highlighted that the EU requires chemicals be proven safe before commerce; US does not
5. **Emotional resonance:** "I cannot stress how important this is... These things are affecting human health"

### Judith Enck

**Position:** Founder/President, Beyond Plastics; Former EPA Region 2 Regional Administrator  
**Expertise:** Environmental policy, plastics regulation, EPR legislation

#### Key Claims

| Claim | Evidence Type | Strength |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Less than 10% (actually 5-6%) of plastics recycled nationally | Dept. of Energy, EPA data | Strong |
| 16,000 different chemicals in plastics make recycling difficult | Research literature | Strong |
| Chemical recycling handles only 1.3% of US plastic | Beyond Plastics/IPEN report | Strong |
| Bottle bill states: 77% aluminum recycling vs 36% non-bottle-bill states | Container Recycling Institute | Strong |
| Bottle bill states: PET plastic recycling 57% vs 17% | Container Recycling Institute | Strong |
| NJ is #2 plastic exporter to other countries (after California) | Industry/trade data | Moderate |

#### Effective Communication Strategies

1. **Props:** Physically demonstrated Amazon packaging waste (nested boxes for highlighters)
2. **Direct challenge to industry narrative:** "Recycling is real—except for plastics"
3. **Policy specificity:** Named states with EPR laws, identified strengths and loopholes
4. **Fuel efficiency analogy:** Compared packaging standards to automotive standards

### Gary Sondermeyer

**Position:** Vice President of Operations, Bayshore Family of Companies; Former NJ DEP Assistant Commissioner  
**Expertise:** Recycling infrastructure, solid waste management

#### Key Claims

| Claim | Evidence Type | Strength |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| NJ recovered 127,000 tons of plastics in most recent year | NJ DEP database | Strong |
| 75% overall container recycling rate in NJ; 57% plastic | NJ DEP data | Strong |
| Average 133,000 tons plastics recovered per year (5-year avg) | NJ DEP data | Strong |
| 1.67 metric tons CO2 avoided per ton of MSW recycled | US EPA | Strong |

#### Communication Approach

- Represented industry perspective (Association of NJ Recyclers)
- Opposed bottle bill legislation, citing threat to existing MRF infrastructure
- Supported EPR with needs-assessment component

## Part III: Legislative Interest Analysis

### Questions Asked by Legislators

The questions legislators asked reveal which scientific claims resonated most:

1. **Assemblywoman Katz:** Asked whether school air filtration systems would filter microplastics
2. **Senator Smith:** Asked about scale of plastic production (billions of tons)
3. **Multiple members:** Asked about bottle bills vs. curbside convenience
4. **Assemblyman Inganamort (R):** Asked about preferred plastic recycling method
5. **Assemblywoman Hall:** Suggested targeting youth education in schools

### Legislative Interest by Topic

| Topic | Interest Level | Key Concerns |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Human health impacts | High | Constituents exposed without consent |
| Fetal/reproductive effects | High | Intergenerational impacts |
| Bottle bill | Mixed | Convenience vs. effectiveness |
| EPR/Packaging reduction | High | Taxpayer burden shifting |
| Chemical recycling | Moderate | Desire for solutions but skeptical |

## Part IV: Legislative Outcomes

### Recommendations Emerging from Hearing

#### Strongly Supported (bipartisan interest indicated)

1. **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** — Both industry and advocates support
2. **Statewide Uniform Recyclables List** — Addresses confusion
3. **Packaging Reduction Standards** — Fuel-efficiency analogy resonated

#### Debated

4. **Bottle Bill/Deposit Container Law** — Strong support and opposition
5. **Chemical Recycling Regulation** — Agreement it's not working

#### Flagged for Future Action

6. **Plastic Export Restrictions** — Environmental justice concerns
7. **School-Based Recycling/Composting Integration**

---

## Part V: What Made Scientific Engagement Effective

### Successful Strategies

1. **Peer-Reviewed Research + Human Impact Narrative**
   - Dr. Swan's description of the Phthalate Syndrome research journey combined scientific rigor with a story legislators could follow
   - The 15-year Hawaii placenta study (60% → 90% → 100% contamination) provided a clear trend

2. **Local Relevance**
   - Dr. Stapleton's citations of Rutgers research on NJ rivers made the issue immediate
   - Sondermeyer's operational data from NJ MRFs provided local economic context

3. **Regulatory Precedent**
   - Comparisons to fuel efficiency standards gave legislators models
   - Citations of prior testimony influencing federal law demonstrated the research-to-policy pathway

4. **Visual and Physical Demonstrations**
   - Enck's Amazon packaging prop was cited multiple times
   - Dr. Stapleton's printed figures showing placenta contamination trends

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **More NJ-Specific Health Data** — No NJ-specific human health studies cited
2. **Economic Analysis of Health Costs** — Would have balanced industry economic arguments
3. **Direct Connection to Pending Legislation** — Policy recommendations remained general
