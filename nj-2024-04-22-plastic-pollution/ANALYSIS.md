# Effective Scientific Engagement in the Legislative Process

## A Case Study: New Jersey Plastic Pollution Hearing
**April 22, 2024 (Earth Day)**

---

## Executive Summary

On April 22, 2024, the New Jersey Senate Environment and Energy Committee and Assembly Environment, Natural Resources, and Solid Waste Committee held a joint hearing on plastic pollution—a model of how scientific testimony can inform legislative policy. This analysis examines how scientific experts engaged with legislators, the quality and impact of their testimony, and the legislative outcomes that emerged from or were influenced by the hearing.

**Key Finding:** Scientific testimony was most effective when it combined rigorous peer-reviewed research with human health narratives that resonated with legislators' concerns about their constituents. The hearing demonstrates that effective scientific engagement requires not just presenting data, but framing it in terms of policy-relevant outcomes.

## Part IV: Legislative Outcomes Analysis

### Pre-Existing Legislation Referenced as Foundation

| Legislation | Year | Connection to Hearing |
|-------------|------|----------------------|
| Recycling Enhancement Act | 1987 | Foundation for current system; cited as needing updates |
| Clean Communities Act | 1986 | First EPR in NJ; litter prevention model |
| Recycled Content Requirements | 2024 | Recent success; milestones began Jan 2024 |
| Recycling Market Development Council | 2022 | 15 recommendations pending implementation |
| Plastic Bag Ban | 2022 | Success cited as behavior-change model |

### Legislative Recommendations Emerging from Hearing

Based on testimony, the following legislative actions were recommended:

#### Strongly Supported (bipartisan interest indicated)
1. **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** - Both industry (ANJR) and advocates (Beyond Plastics) support, though with different emphasis
2. **Statewide Uniform Recyclables List** - Addresses confusion, reduces "wishful recycling"
3. **Packaging Reduction Standards** - Enck's strongest recommendation; fuel-efficiency analogy resonated

#### Debated (tension visible)
4. **Bottle Bill/Deposit Container Law** - Enck strongly supports; Sondermeyer strongly opposes (threatens MRF economics)
5. **Chemical Recycling Regulation** - Agreement it's not working; disagreement on how to address

#### Flagged for Future Action
6. **Plastic Export Restrictions** - NJ as #2 exporter raised environmental justice concerns
7. **School-Based Recycling/Composting Integration** - Building on climate education mandate

---

## Part V: Effectiveness Assessment—What Worked?

### Most Effective Scientific Engagement Strategies

1. **Peer-Reviewed Research + Human Impact Narrative**
   - Dr. Swan's description of the Phthalate Syndrome research journey—from NTP rat studies to human replication—combined scientific rigor with a story legislators could follow
   - The 15-year Hawaii placenta study (60% → 90% → 100% contamination) provided a clear trend

2. **Local Relevance**
   - Dr. Stapleton's citations of Rutgers research on NJ rivers (Raritan, Passaic) made the issue immediate
   - Sondermeyer's operational data from NJ MRFs provided local economic context

3. **Regulatory Precedent**
   - Enck's comparisons to fuel efficiency standards and California EPR law gave legislators models
   - Dr. Swan's citation of her testimony influencing the 2008 Consumer Protection Act demonstrated research-to-policy pathway

4. **Addressing Counterarguments Directly**
   - Enck confronted the "recycling is working" narrative with DOE/EPA data
   - Both sides of the bottle bill debate presented, allowing legislators to weigh trade-offs

5. **Visual and Physical Demonstrations**
   - Enck's Amazon packaging prop (4 nested boxes for highlighters) was cited multiple times
   - Dr. Stapleton's printed figures showing placenta contamination trends

### What Would Have Strengthened Scientific Engagement

1. **More NJ-Specific Health Data**
   - No NJ-specific human health studies cited; all research was national or international
   - A study on microplastics in NJ residents would have been more compelling

2. **Economic Analysis of Health Costs**
   - No estimates of healthcare costs associated with plastic-related health impacts
   - This would have balanced Sondermeyer's economic arguments for recycling

3. **Direct Connection to Pending Legislation**
   - Scientists could have referenced specific bill numbers and provisions
   - Policy recommendations remained general rather than bill-specific

4. **Written Testimony Coordination**
   - Industry witnesses (Plastics Industry Association, Tekni-Plex) only submitted written testimony
   - No scientific rebuttal to industry claims was possible in real-time

---

## Part VI: Key Takeaways for Effective Scientific Engagement

### For Scientists Testifying Before Legislative Bodies

1. **Frame research in terms of constituent impact**
   - "Your constituents have microplastics in their bodies without their knowledge or consent"
   - Health outcomes resonate more than environmental metrics alone

2. **Provide scale that matters locally**
   - Reference local institutions (Rutgers, NJ DEP data)
   - Translate global production figures into NJ-relevant impacts

3. **Describe the research process**
   - Dr. Swan's "another $5 million, another five years" built credibility
   - Shows scientific claims aren't casual assertions

4. **Connect to existing legislative action**
   - Reference recent legislative successes (plastic bag ban, recycled content law)
   - Build on momentum rather than starting fresh

5. **Anticipate and address counterarguments**
   - The recycling rate dispute (9% vs 50-90%) confused legislators
   - Scientists should preempt such disputes with clear methodology explanations

### For Legislators Seeking Scientific Input

1. **Invite scientists with directly relevant research**
   - Dr. Stapleton's lab focuses on exactly what the hearing addressed
   - Dr. Swan's decades of phthalate research was foundational

2. **Structure hearings to allow follow-up**
   - Scientists could have responded to industry testimony
   - Q&A could have addressed the recycling rate discrepancy

3. **Request specific policy recommendations**
   - "What specific provisions should legislation include?"
   - Scientists often stay in their lane; direct questions draw out policy insights

## Part VII: Legislative Influence Assessment

### Evidence of Scientific Testimony Influencing Legislative Discussion

| Scientific Claim | Observable Legislative Response |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| NEJM cardiovascular study (March 2024) | Chairman Smith cited this in opening remarks |
| Bottle bill recycling rates (57% vs 17%) | Extensive Q&A on bottle bill feasibility |
| 100% placental contamination by 2021 | No questions asked, but no challenge either |
| Chemical recycling failure (1.3%) | Skeptical questions about industry "solutions" |
| Sperm count decline 50% since 1970 | Silence—possibly too sensitive for public hearing |

### Likely Legislative Impact

Based on hearing transcript analysis, the following legislative actions appear likely:

1. **Extended Producer Responsibility bill** - Strong bipartisan support; expect drafting
2. **Uniform Recyclables List** - Near-term implementation expected
3. **Chemical Recycling restrictions** - Likely to be included in any EPR framework
4. **Bottle Bill** - Remains contentious; may not advance without MRF economic mitigation
