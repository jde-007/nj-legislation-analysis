STATEMENT 
17 
 
18 
 
This bill prohibits health club services contracts from limiting 
19 
the liability of the health club to a buyer for injuries caused by or 
20 
resulting from the negligence of the owner or operator, or an agent 
21 
or employee of the owner or operator, of the health club. 
22 
 
This bill is intended to codify Justice Albin’s dissent in the case 
23 
of Pulice v. Green Brook Sports & Fitness, 236 N.J. 1 (2018); see 
24 
also Stelluti v. Casapenn, 203 N.J. 286 (2010) (Albin, J., dissenting) 
25 
(arguing that a contract limiting a health club’s liability from its 
26 
own negligence is void as against public policy).   
27 
 
A violation of this bill would be an unlawful practice pursuant to 
28 
the consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), and is 
29 
punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a 
30 
first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.  
31 
In addition, violations can result in cease and desist orders issued 
32 
by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and 
33 
the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party.
