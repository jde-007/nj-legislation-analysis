BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State 
5 
of New Jersey: 
6 
 
7 
 
1. (New section)  a.  It shall be an unlawful practice and a 
8 
violation of P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) for any person to offer 
9 
for sale, sell, distribute, or import into the State any product or 
10 
packaging for which a deceptive or misleading claim about the 
11 
recyclability of the product or packaging is made. 
12 
 
b. Except as provided in subsection c. of this section, a product 
13 
or packaging that displays a chasing arrows symbol, a chasing 
14 
arrows symbol surrounding a resin identification code, or any other 
15 
symbol or statement indicating the product or packaging is 
16 
recyclable, or otherwise directing the consumer to recycle the 
17 
product or packaging, shall be considered a deceptive or misleading 
18 
claim pursuant to this section, unless the product or packaging is 
19 
considered recyclable in the State pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    
20 
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and is of a 
21 
material type and form that routinely becomes feedstock used in the 
22 
production of new products or packaging. 
23 
 
(1)  If a product or packaging has multiple material types, a 
24 
chasing arrows symbol or statement indicating recyclability may be 
25 
displayed on its external packaging if the external packaging is 
26 
considered to be recyclable in the State pursuant to section 2 of 
27 
P.L     , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), 
28 
and if the chasing arrows symbol or statement makes clear, in the 
29 
same or greater font size or symbol size, which other components of 
30 
the product or packaging are not recyclable. 
31 
 
(2)  Displaying a chasing arrows symbol or any other statement 
32 
indicating recyclability on packaging containing a consumable 
33 
product shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to refer 
34 
only to the packaging. 
35 
 
c. 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to: 
36 
 
(1)  any product or packaging that is manufactured up to 18 
37 
months after the date the Department of Environmental Protection 
38 
publishes the first material characterization study required pursuant 
39 
to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature 
40 
as this bill), or before January 1, 2024, whichever is later; 
41 
 
(2)  any product or packaging manufactured up to 18 months 
42 
after the date the Department of Environmental Protection updates 
43 
the material characterization study pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , 
44 


=== Page 3 ===
 
A2775 GREENWALD 
3 
 
 
c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), if the 
1 
product or packaging satisfied or, for a new product or packaging, 
2 
would have satisfied, the requirements to be considered recyclable 
3 
in the State before the publication of the updated study; 
4 
 
(3) the use of a chasing arrows symbol in combination with a 
5 
clearly visible line placed at a 45-degree angle over the chasing 
6 
arrows symbol to convey that an item is not recyclable; 
7 
 
(4) any product or packaging that is required by any federal or 
8 
State law, rule, or regulation to display a chasing arrows symbol, 
9 
including, but not limited to, Section 103(b)(1) of the federal 
10 
Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act 
11 
(42 U.S.C. Sec. 14322(b)(1)); 
12 
 
(5)  text or symbols that direct a consumer to compost or 
13 
properly dispose of any product or packaging through an organics 
14 
recycling program; or 
15 
 
(6)  the use of a resin identification code placed inside a solid 
16 
equilateral triangle. 
17 
 
d. For the purposes of this section: 
18 
 
"Consumable product" means a commodity that is intended to be 
19 
used and not disposed of. 
20 
 
"Chasing arrows symbol" means an equilateral triangle, formed 
21 
by three arrows curved at their midpoints, depicting a clockwise 
22 
path, with a short gap separating the apex of each arrow from the 
23 
base of the adjacent arrow.  "Chasing arrows symbol" also includes 
24 
variants of that symbol that are likely to be interpreted by a 
25 
consumer as an implication of recyclability, including, but not 
26 
limited to, one or more arrows arranged in a circular pattern or 
27 
around a globe. 
28 
 
29 
 
2. (New section)  a.  On or before January 1, 2024, in order to 
30 
provide information to the public sufficient for evaluating whether a 
31 
product or packaging is recyclable in the State and is of a material 
32 
type and form that routinely becomes feedstock used in the 
33 
production of new products or packaging, the department shall 
34 
conduct a material characterization study of material types and 
35 
forms that are collected, sorted, sold, or transferred by recycling 
36 
centers and solid waste facilities deemed appropriate by the 
37 
department for inclusion in the study.  The study shall identify the 
38 
products and forms of packaging that are deemed to be recyclable in 
39 
the State and permitted to display the chasing arrows symbol 
40 
pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the 
41 
Legislature as this bill). 
42 
 
(1) The department shall update the material characterization 
43 
study required pursuant to this subsection every five years, with the 
44 
first update being issued by the department no later than January 1, 
45 
2027. 
46 
 
(2)  For purposes of studying a representative sample of material 
47 
types and forms in the State, within 90 days after receiving a 
48 


=== Page 4 ===
 
A2775 GREENWALD 
4 
 
 
request from the department, a recycling center shall allow for 
1 
periodic sampling conducted by a designated representative of the 
2 
department on a mutually-agreed upon date and time. The 
3 
department shall not request a periodic sampling of a recycling 
4 
center if that center was sampled during the previous 24 months. 
5 
 
(3)  For each material characterization study conducted pursuant 
6 
to this subsection, the department shall publish on its Internet 
7 
website the preliminary findings of the study and conduct a public 
8 
hearing to present the preliminary findings and receive public 
9 
comments. The hearing shall occur at least 30 days after the 
10 
department publishes the preliminary findings.  The department 
11 
shall provide public notice of the hearing by posting the time, date, 
12 
and location on its Internet website at least 30 days prior to the 
13 
hearing.  After receiving and considering public comments, and 
14 
within 60 days after the hearing, the department shall finalize the 
15 
findings of the study and publish the study on its Internet website. 
16 
 
(4)  The department’s activities pursuant to this subsection, 
17 
including the department’s determination of the appropriate 
18 
recycling centers to include in the material characterization study, 
19 
shall be exempt from the provisions of the "Administrative 
20 
Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 
21 
 
b. Except as provided in subsection c. of this section, a product 
22 
or packaging shall be considered recyclable in the State if, based on 
23 
information published by the department pursuant to subsection a. 
24 
of this section, the product or packaging is of a material type and 
25 
form that meets both of the following requirements: 
26 
 
(1)  the material type and form is collected for recycling by 
27 
curbside recycling programs for jurisdictions that collectively 
28 
encompass at least 60 percent of the population of the State; and 
29 
 
(2)  the material type and form is sorted into defined streams for 
30 
recycling by transfer stations, materials recovery facilities, or 
31 
recycling centers that collectively serve at least 60 percent of 
32 
recycling programs Statewide, with the defined streams sent to and 
33 
utilized at a facility that transforms the materials into usable 
34 
products or feedstocks. 
35 
 
c. 
A product or packaging shall not be considered recyclable 
36 
pursuant to this section, if the product or packaging: 
37 
 
(1)  includes any components, inks, adhesives, or labels that 
38 
prevent the recyclability of the packaging according to the APR 
39 
Design Guide published by the Association of Plastic Recyclers; 
40 
 
(2)  contains an intentionally added chemical that has been 
41 
identified as hazardous pursuant to the "Worker and Community 
42 
Right to Know Act," P.L.1983, c.315 (C.34:5A-1 et seq.); 
43 
 
(3)  is made from plastic or fiber that contains perfluoroalkyl or 
44

3 
fluorine. 
4 
 
d. Notwithstanding the provisions of section b. and c. of this 
5 
section to the contrary: 
6 
 
(1)  any product or packaging shall be deemed by the department 
7 
to be recyclable in the State if the product or packaging has a 
8 
demonstrated recycling rate of at least 75 percent, meaning that not 
9 
less than 75 percent of the product or packaging sorted and 
10 
aggregated in the State is reprocessed into new products or 
11 
packaging; 
12 
 
(2)  prior to January 1, 2030, a product or packaging that is not 
13 
collected through a curbside collection program shall be deemed by 
14 
the department to be recyclable, if the non-curbside collection 
15 
methods in the State recover at least 60 percent of the product or 
16 
packaging used in the State and the material has sufficient 
17 
commercial value to be marketed for recycling and be transported at 
18 
the end of its useful life to a transfer station, materials recovery 
19 
facility, or recycling center to be sorted and aggregated into defined 
20 
streams by material type and form; 
21 
 
(3)  after January 1, 2030, a product or packaging that is not 
22 
collected through a curbside collection program shall be deemed by 
23

29 
streams by material type and form; and 
30 
 
(4)  a product or packaging shall be deemed by the department to 
31 
be recyclable, if the product or packaging is part of, and in 
32 
compliance with, a program established pursuant to State or federal 
33 
law on or after January 1, 2022, governing the recyclability or 
34 
disposal of that product or packaging, and if the department 
35 
determines that the product or packaging will not increase 
36 
contamination of curbside recycling or deceive consumers as to the 
37 
recyclability of the product or packaging. 
38 
 
e. 
The department may adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to 
39 
the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et 
40 
seq.), to require the operator of any recycling center in the State to 
41 
annually submit to the department each year (a) information about 
42 
how the material collected or processed by the center was collected, 
43 
and (b) what material types and forms are actively recycled, and not 
44

7 
 
3. Section 2 of P.L.1989, c.268 (C.13:1E-99.41) is amended to 
8 
read as follows: 
9 
 
2. a.  On or after January 1, 1991, no person shall sell, offer for 
10 
sale, or distribute any plastic bottle or plastic container in this State 
11 
unless the bottle or container is labeled with a material code 
12 
indicating the plastic resin used to produce the bottle or container.  
13 
Any plastic bottle or plastic container with a label or basecup 
14 
affixed thereto, the composition of which consists of a different 
15 
material than the bottle or container itself, shall be coded by its 
16 
basic material.   
17 
 
b.  The material code shall consist of a uniform symbol and 
18 
identification number, and an acronym comprising no more than 
19 
five letters.  The symbol shall consist of a [triangular-shaped 
20 
configuration of three arrows with a specific number placed within 
21 
the center of the symbol to indicate the composition of the material 
22 
used to produce the bottle or container.  The acronym shall be 
23 
placed below the triangle of arrows.  The triangle shall be 
24 
equilateral, formed by three arrows with the apex of each point of 
25 
the triangle at the midpoint of each arrow, rounded with a short 
26 
radius.  The pointer (arrowhead) of each arrow shall be at the 
27 
midpoint of each side of the triangle with a short gap separating the 
28 
pointer from the base of the adjacent arrow.  The triangle, formed 
29 
by the three arrows curved at their midpoints shall depict a 
30 
clockwise path around the code number] a solid equilateral triangle. 
31 
 
c. 
The material code shall consist of an identification number 
32 
and acronym as follows: 
33

STATEMENT 
1 
 
2 
 
This bill would make the sale, import, or distribution of any 
3 
product or packaging that makes a deceptive or misleading claim 
4 
about the recyclability of the product or packaging a violation of 
5 
P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), commonly known as the 
6 
“Consumer Fraud Act.” 
7 
 
Specifically, the bill would prohibit the sale, offering for sale, 
8 
import, and distribution of products that use the "chasing arrows" 
9 
recycling symbol (the well-known symbol that depicts a triangle 
10 
composed of three arrows), unless the product is determined by the 
11 
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to be recyclable in 
12 
the State through material characterization study carried out and 
13 
updated pursuant to the bill.  The bill would establish certain 
14 
exceptions for this prohibition, as enumerated in subsection c. of 
15 
section 1 of the bill, including for products that are manufactured up 
16 
to 18 months after the DEP carries out or updates the material 
17 
characterization study.  As provided by section 1 of P.L.1966, c.39 
18 
(C.56:8-13),  an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act is 
19 
punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a 
20 
first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.  
21 
In addition, a violation can result in cease and desist orders issued 
22 
by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages and 
23 
the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured. 
24 
 
The bill would direct the DEP to conduct a material 
25 
characterization study of material types and forms that are 
26 
collected, sorted, sold, or transferred by recycling centers and solid 
27 
waste facilities in the State.  The study would be required to 
28 
identify the products and forms of packaging that are deemed to be 
29 
recyclable in the State and therefore permitted to display the 
30 
chasing arrows symbol pursuant to section 1 of the bill.  The first 
31 
study would be required to be conducted by January 1, 2024, the 
32 
second study by January 1, 2027, and subsequent studies every five 
33 
years after 2027.  The bill would also require the DEP to hold a 
34 
public meeting on its findings prior the final publication of each 
35 
study.  The bill would establish certain requirements regarding the 
36 
DEP's identification of recyclable products, as enumerated in 
37 
subsections b. through d. of section 2 of the bill.  In particular, the 
38 
bill would require that products and packaging that are (1) collected 
39 
by curbside recycling programs that collectively account for 60 
40 
percent of the State's population, and (2) sorted into defined streams 
41 
for recycling processes by transfer stations, materials recovery 
42 
facilities, or recycling centers that collectively serve at least 60 
43 
percent of recycling programs Statewide would be deemed 
44 
recyclable by the DEP.  The bill would also explicitly exclude 
45 
certain products – such as those that contain hazardous chemicals or 
46 
perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – from being 
47 
deemed recyclable by the DEP.  In addition, the bill would direct 
48 


=== Page 8 ===
 
A2775 GREENWALD 
8 
 
 
the DEP to deem certain other products recyclable, as described in 
1 
subsection d. of section 2 of the bill, including certain products that 
2 
are widely recycled through non-curbside collection programs. 
3 
 
The bill would also authorize the DEP to adopt rules and 
4 
regulations that would require the operators of recycling centers in 
5 
the State to provide certain information each year to the DEP, in 
6 
order to assist with its material characterization study. 
7 
 
Finally, the bill would amend existing law, which requires the 
8 
using of the chasing arrows symbol on certain plastic bottles and 
9 
containers sold in the State, in order to make it consistent with the 
10 
bill's provisions.
