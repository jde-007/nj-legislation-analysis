15 
 
(6)  notify the public of a manufacturer that is not in compliance 
16 
with the requirements of this act. 
17 
 
b. Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated 
18 
this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, the 
19 
commissioner may issue an administrative enforcement order 
20 
specifying the provision or provisions of this act, or the rule or 
21 
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, of which the person is in 
22 
violation, citing the action that constituted the violation, requiring 
23 
compliance with the provision violated, and giving notice to the 
24 
person of the person's right to a hearing on the matters contained in 
25 
the administrative enforcement order.  The ordered person shall 
26 
have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to 
27 
deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After 
28 
the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the 
29 
commissioner may issue a final order.  If no hearing is requested, 
30 
the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day 
31 
period.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect 
32 
of the order. 
33 
 
c. 
The commissioner is authorized to institute a civil action in 
34 
Superior Court for appropriate relief from any violation of the 
35 
provisions of this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant 
36 
thereto.  This relief may include an assessment against the violator

45 
commissioner shall consider the severity of the violation, the 
46 
measures taken to prevent further violations, and whether the 
47 
penalty will maintain an appropriate deterrent.  Prior to assessment 
48

of a civil administrative penalty, the person committing the 
1 
violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that 
2 
the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall identify the section 
3 
of the statute, rule, regulation, or order violated; recite the facts 
4 
alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of 
5 
the civil administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the 
6 
rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall 
7 
have 20 days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to 
8 
the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing 
9 
and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner 
10 
may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine 
11 
specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall 
12 
become a final order after the expiration of the 20-day period.  
13 
Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the 
14 
notice becomes a final order.  The authority to levy an 
15 
administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement 
16 
provisions in this act, and the payment of any assessment shall not 
17 
be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement 
18 
provisions in connection with the violation for which the 
19 
assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil 
20 
administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and 
21 
with conditions the department determines appropriate. 
22 
 
e.  A person who violates any provision of this act, or any rule or 
23 
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or an administrative order 
24

25 
issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay a 
26 
civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection d. of this 
27 
section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement 
28 
on any application, record, report, or other document required to be 
29 
submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, 
30 
to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day of the violation, and 
31 
each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an 
32 
additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any civil penalty 
33 
imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a 
34 
summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 
35 
1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in 
36 
a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  In addition to any 
37 
penalties, costs or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the 
38 
municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator

STATEMENT 
1 
 
2 
 
This bill would establish requirements and prohibitions for the 
3 
sale, offer for sale, and distribution for sale of certain products 
4 
containing intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
5 
substances (PFAS).  As defined in the bill, “PFAS” means non-
6 
polymeric perfluoralkyl substances, saturated polyfluoroalkyl 
7 
substances, and side-chain fluorinated polymers that contain at least 
8 
two fully fluorinated sequential carbon atoms, excluding gases and 
9 
substances that become gases in use that are regulated under various 
10 
state, federal, and international programs, and “intentionally added 
11 
PFAS” means PFAS added to a product or one of the product's 
12 
components to provide a specific characteristic, appearance, or 
13 
quality or to perform a specific function.  “Intentionally added 
14 
PFAS” also includes any degradation byproducts of PFAS. 
15 
 
Specifically, the bill would prohibit, beginning three years after 
16 
the bill’s effective date, the sale, offer for sale, and distribution for 
17 
sale of the following covered products, if they are sold to customers 
18 
for residential use, in the State: (1) apparel; (2) carpet; (3) fabric 
19 
treatment; (4) cosmetics; (5) food packaging; (6) juvenile products; 
20 
(7) feminine hygiene products; (8) ski wax; and (9) textile articles.  
21 
Beginning two years after the bill’s effective date, the bill would 
22 
prohibit the sale, offer for sale, or distribution for sale in the State 
23 
of any new, not previously used, outdoor apparel designed for 
24 
severe wet conditions containing intentionally added PFAS unless 
25 
the outdoor apparel designed for severe wet conditions is labeled 
26 
with a legible and easily discernable notification that reads “Made 
27 
with PFAS” to inform consumers that the product contains PFAS.  
28 
The bill would also prohibit, beginning five years after the bill’s 
29 
effective date, the sale, offer for sale, or distribution for sale in the 
30 
State of outdoor apparel designed for severe wet conditions 
31 
containing intentionally added PFAS. 
32 
 
In addition, the bill would require, beginning one year after the 
33 
bill’s effective date, manufacturers of cookware sold in the State 
34 
that contains intentionally added PFAS in the handle of the product 
35 
or in any product surface that comes into contact with food, 
36 
foodstuffs, or beverages to list the presence of PFAS on the product 
37 
label.  The product label of a cookware product containing 
38 
intentionally added PFAS would be required to include a statement, 
39 
in both English and Spanish, that reads: “This product contains 
40 
PFAS,” and an internet website and quick response (QR) code that 
41 
links to a website providing information about the reasons PFAS is 
42 
intentionally added to the product.  The bill provides certain 
43 
exemptions to the labeling requirements for certain cookware.  
44 
Beginning one year after the bill’s effective date, the bill would 
45 
prohibit the sale, offer for sale, and distribution for sale of 
46 
cookware containing intentionally added PFAS unless the cookware

and the manufacturer of the cookware has complied with the bill’s 
1 
labeling requirements. 
2 
 
The bill would also prohibit, beginning two years after the bill’s 
3 
effective date, a person, local government, or State agency from 
4 
discharging for training purposes class B firefighting foam 
5 
containing intentionally added PFAS.  The bill would prohibit, 
6 
beginning two years after the bill’s effective date, a person, local 
7 
government, or State agency from discharging for testing purposes 
8 
class B firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS, 
9 
unless otherwise required by law or the authority having 
10 
jurisdiction and the testing facility has implemented appropriate 
11 
containment, treatment, and disposal measures to prevent releases 
12 
of the class B firefighting foam into the environment.  The bill’s 
13 
provisions concerning class B firefighting foam would not restrict 
14 
the manufacture, sale, or distribution of class B firefighting foam 
15 
containing intentionally added PFAS or the discharge or use of 
16 
class B firefighting foam in emergency firefighting or fire 
17 
prevention operations. In addition, beginning two years after the 
18 
bill’s effective date, for the purposes of training for firefighting 
19 
operations, fire departments would be required to utilize non-
20 
fluorinated training foams or other non-fluorinated surrogates.  
21 
Training for firefighting operations would be required to be 
22 
conducted under conditions conducive to the collection of spent 
23 
firefighting foam regardless of the type of foam being utilized. 
24 
 
The bill would establish a civil administrative penalty of not less 
25 
than $1,000 nor more than $20,000 for each violation of the bill's 
26 
provisions.  The bill would also establish a civil penalty not to 
27 
exceed $25,000 for a violation of the bill’s provisions.  The 
28 
penalties would be assessed for each day during which the 
29 
violations continued.
