BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State 
4 
of New Jersey: 
5 
 
6 
 
1.  Section 5 of P.L.2002, c.128 (C.13:1E-217) is amended to 
7 
read as follows:  
8 
 
5. The Clean Communities Program Fund is established as a 
9 
nonlapsing, revolving fund in the Department of the Treasury.  The 
10 
Clean Communities Program Fund shall be administered by the 
11 
Department of Environmental Protection and credited, in addition to 
12 
any appropriations made thereto, with all user fees imposed 
13 
pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.128 (C.13:1E-216) or penalties 
14 
imposed pursuant to section 10 of P.L.2002, c.128 (C.13:1E-222), 
15 
and any sums received as voluntary contributions from private 
16 
sources.  Interest received on moneys in the Clean Communities 
17 
Program Fund shall be credited to the fund.  Unless otherwise 
18 
expressly provided by the specific appropriation thereof by the 
19 
Legislature, which shall take the form of a discrete legislative 
20 
appropriations act and shall not be included within the annual 
21 
appropriations act, all available moneys in the Clean Communities 
22 
Program Fund shall be appropriated annually solely for the 
23 
following purposes and no others: 
24 
 
a. 
10 percent of the estimated annual balance of the Clean 
25 
Communities Program Fund shall be used for a State program of 
26 
litter pickup and removal and of enforcement of litter-related laws 
27 
and ordinances in State owned places and areas that are accessible 
28 
to the public.  Moneys in the fund may also be used by the State to 
29 
abate graffiti; 
30 
 
b. 50 percent of the estimated annual balance of the Clean 
31 
Communities Program Fund shall be distributed as State aid to 
32 
eligible municipalities with total housing units of 200 or more for 
33 
programs of litter pickup and removal, including establishing an 
34 
"Adopt-A-Highway" program, of public education and information 
35 
relating to litter abatement and of enforcement of litter-related laws 
36 
and ordinances.  The amount of State aid due each municipality 
37 
shall be solely calculated based on the proportion which the housing 
38 
units of a qualifying municipality bear to the total housing units in 
39 
the State.  Total housing units shall be determined using the most 
40 
recent federal decennial population estimates for New Jersey and its 
41 
municipalities, filed in the office of the Secretary of State.  Moneys 
42 
in the fund may also be used by an eligible municipality to abate 
43 
graffiti; 
44 
 
c. 
30 percent of the estimated annual balance of the Clean 
45 
Communities Program Fund shall be distributed as State aid to 
46

eligible municipalities with total housing units of 200 or more for 
1 
programs of litter pickup and removal, including establishing an 
2 
"Adopt-A-Highway" program, of public education and information 
3 
relating to litter abatement and of enforcement of litter-related laws 
4 
and ordinances.  The amount of State aid due each municipality 
5 
shall be solely calculated based on the proportion which the 
6 
municipal road mileage of a qualifying municipality bears to the 
7 
total municipal road mileage within the State.  For the purposes of 
8 
this subsection, "municipal road mileage" means that road mileage 
9 
under the jurisdiction of municipalities, as determined by the 
10 
Department of Transportation.  Moneys in the fund may also be 
11 
used by an eligible municipality to abate graffiti; 
12 
 
d. 10 percent of the estimated annual balance of the Clean 
13 
Communities Program Fund shall be distributed as State aid to 
14 
eligible counties for programs of litter pickup and removal, 
15 
including establishing an "Adopt-A-Highway" program, of public 
16 
education and information relating to litter abatement and of 
17 
enforcement of litter-related laws and ordinances.  The amount of 
18 
State aid due each county shall be solely calculated based on the 
19 
proportion which the county road mileage of an eligible county 
20 
bears to the total county road mileage within the State.  For the 
21 
purposes of this subsection, "county road mileage" means that road 
22 
mileage under the jurisdiction of counties, as determined by the 
23 
Department of Transportation.  Moneys in the fund may also be 
24 
used by an eligible county to abate graffiti; 
25 
 
e. 
No eligible municipality shall receive less than $4,000 in 
26 
State aid as apportioned pursuant to subsections b. and c. of this 
27 
section.  A municipality or county may use up to five percent of its 
28 
State aid for administrative expenses; 
29 
 
f. 
Prior to the distribution of funds pursuant to subsections a. 
30 
through d. of this section, [:

40 
media advertising campaign to promote antilittering and responsible 
41 
solid waste handling behavior.

STATEMENT 
35 
 
 
36 
 
This bill repeals the law establishing a ban on single-use plastic 
37 
carryout bags, single-use paper carryout bags, polystyrene foam 
38 
food service products, and single-use plastic straws.  The bill also 
39 
amends a portion of the law which established a $500,000 
40 
appropriation, from the Clean Communities Fund, for a public 
41 
information and education program regarding free reusable carryout 
42 
bags.  The amendments would remove that appropriation.  Current 
43 
law prohibits stores and food service business from providing or 
44 
selling single-use plastic carryout bags to customers, and prohibits 
45 
grocery stores from providing or selling single-use paper carryout 
46 
bags to customers.  The law also prohibits distribution of 
47 
polystyrene foam food service products.  A Plastics Advisory

Council monitors the implementation of the law, and fees collected 
1 
from establishments, in violation of the law, currently accrue to the 
2 
Clean Communities Program Fund.  
3 
 
It is the sponsor’s intention to eliminate this law in its entirety, 
4 
as it has resulted in an increased volume of waste in the State 
5 
through the production and accumulation of unused bags, straws, 
6 
and other disposable products.  Research indicates that plastic bag 
7 
bans have been associated with increased purchasing of alternative 
8 
bags and containers and a resultant increase in manufacturing-
9 
related pollution.  New Jersey stores and food service businesses 
10 
have noticed a three-fold increase in plastic consumption since the 
11 
implementation of this law, attributed to the non-recyclable material 
12 
used in alternative bags.  Carryout grocery bag regulations have 
13 
also been associated with a 127-pound monthly average increase in 
14 
the number of purchased plastics.  This bill would take effect on the 
15 
60th day after the date of enactment to allow business and stores two 
16 
months to restore available supplies of single-use plastic carryout 
17 
bags, single-use paper carryout bags, polystyrene foam food service 
18 
products, and single-use plastic straws.
