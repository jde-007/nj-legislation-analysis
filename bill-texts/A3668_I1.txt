STATEMENT 
1 
 
2 
 
This bill requires health insurers (health, hospital and medical 
3 
service corporations, commercial individual and group health  
4 
insurers; health maintenance organizations, health benefits plans 
5 
issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage and 
6 
Small Employer Health Benefits Programs, the State Health  
7 
Benefits Program, and the School Employees’ Health Benefits  
8 
Program) to provide health benefits coverage for any expenses  
9 
incurred by a covered person for the prescription and purchase of  
10 
buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of  
11 
pain. The bill provides that coverage is not subject to step therapy 
12 
or fail-first protocols. 
13 
 
Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone, are medications 
14 
that are used to treat chronic pain. This bill seeks to make these 
15 
medications more readily available for people with chronic pain by 
16 
prohibiting health insurers from applying step therapy or fail-first 
17 
protocols as a condition for coverage.  These protocols are a type of 
18 
prior authorization which currently may be used by health insurers 
19 
to require patients to use riskier, more addictive drugs for the 
20 
treatment 
of 
pain, 
before 
using 
buprenorphine 
and 
21 
buprenorphine/naloxone, which are less addictive and less likely to 
22 
be abused by patients.
