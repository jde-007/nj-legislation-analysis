 EXPLANATION – Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is 
not enacted and is intended to be omitted in the law. 
 
 Matter underlined thus is new matter. 
 
 
AN ACT requiring COAH to administer the affordable housing 
1 
obligations of municipalities based on a statewide obligation and 
2 
amending and repealing various parts of the statutory law. 
3 
 
4 
 
BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State 
5 
of New Jersey: 
6 
 
7 
 
1. Section 2 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-302) is amended to 
8 
read as follows: 
9 
 
2. The Legislature finds that:  
10 
 
a. 
The New Jersey Supreme Court, through its rulings in South 
11 
Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 67 N.J. 151 (1975) 
12 
and South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92 N.J. 158 
13 
(1983), has determined that every municipality in a growth area has 
14 
a constitutional obligation to provide through its land use 
15 
regulations a realistic opportunity for a fair share of its region's 
16 
present and prospective needs for housing for low and moderate 
17 
income families. 
18 
 
b. In the second Mount Laurel ruling, the Supreme Court stated 
19 
that the determination of the methods for satisfying this 
20 
constitutional obligation "is better left to the Legislature," that the 
21 
court has "always preferred legislative to judicial action in their 
22 
field," and that the judicial role in upholding the Mount Laurel 
23 
doctrine "could decrease as a result of legislative and executive 
24 
action." 
25 
 
c. 
The interest of all citizens, including low and moderate 
26 
income families in need of affordable housing, and the needs of the 
27 
workforce, would be best served by a comprehensive planning and 
28 
implementation response to this constitutional obligation. 
29 
 
d. There are a number of essential ingredients to a 
30 
comprehensive planning and implementation response, including 
31 
the establishment of reasonable fair share housing guidelines and 
32 
standards, the [initial] determination of fair share by officials at the 
33 
[municipal] State level [and the] , municipal preparation of a 
34 
municipal housing element, State review of the [local fair share 
35 
study and] housing element and formation of a plan to achieve the 
36 
municipal fair share, and continuous State funding for low and 
37 
moderate income housing to replace the federal housing subsidy 
38 
programs which have been almost completely eliminated. 
39 
 
e. 
The State can maximize the number of low and moderate 
40 
income units provided in New Jersey by allowing its municipalities 
41 
to adopt appropriate phasing schedules for meeting their fair share, 
42 
so long as the municipalities permit a timely achievement of an 
43 
appropriate fair share of the [regional] need for low and moderate 
44 


=== Page 3 ===
 
S2104 SCHEPISI 
3 
 
 
income housing as required by the Mt. Laurel I and II opinions and 
1 
other relevant court decisions. 
2 
 
f. 
The State can also maximize the number of low and 
3 
moderate income units by creating new affordable housing and by 
4 
rehabilitating existing, but substandard, housing in the State.  
5 
Because the Legislature has determined, pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 
6 
(C.52:27D-329.1 et al.), that it is no longer appropriate or in 
7 
harmony with the Mount Laurel doctrine to permit the transfer of 
8 
the fair share obligations among municipalities within a housing 
9 
region, it is necessary and appropriate to create a new program to 
10 
create new affordable housing and to foster the rehabilitation of 
11 
existing, but substandard, housing. 
12 
 
g. Since the urban areas are vitally important to the State, 
13 
construction, conversion and rehabilitation of housing in our urban 
14 
centers should be encouraged.  However, the provision of housing 
15 
in urban areas must be balanced with the need to provide housing 
16 
throughout the State for the free mobility of citizens. 
17 
 
h. The Supreme Court of New Jersey in its Mount Laurel 
18 
decisions demands that municipal land use regulations affirmatively 
19 
afford a reasonable opportunity for a variety and choice of housing 
20 
including low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs of 
21 
people desiring to live there.  While provision for the actual 
22 
construction of that housing by municipalities is not required, they 
23 
are encouraged but not mandated to expend their own resources to 
24 
help provide low and moderate income housing. 
25 
 
i. 
Certain amendments to the enabling act of the Council on 
26 
Affordable Housing are necessary to provide guidance to the 
27 
council to ensure consistency with the legislative intent, while at the 
28 
same time clarifying the limitations of the council in its rulemaking.  
29 
Although the court has remarked in several decisions that the 
30 
Legislature has granted the council considerable deference in its 
31 
rulemaking, the Legislature retains its power and obligation to 
32 
clarify and amend the enabling act from which the council derives 
33 
its rulemaking power, from time to time, in order to better guide the 
34 
council. 
35 
 
j. 
The Legislature finds that the use of regional contribution 
36 
agreements, which permits municipalities to transfer a certain 
37 
portion of their fair share housing obligation outside of the 
38 
municipal borders, should no longer be utilized as a mechanism for 
39 
the creation of affordable housing by the council.

S2104 SCHEPISI 
6 
 
 
the Statewide housing need to be fulfilled in [a given region] each 
1 
such municipality, which shall be computed for a 10-year period. 
2 
 
Municipal fair share shall be determined after crediting on a one-
3 
to-one basis each current unit of low and moderate income housing 
4 
of adequate standard, including any such housing constructed or 
5 
acquired as part of a housing program specifically intended to 
6 
provide housing for low and moderate income households.  
7 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a municipality shall 
8 
be entitled to a credit for a unit if it demonstrates that (a) the 
9 
municipality issued a certificate of occupancy for the unit, which 
10 
was either newly constructed or rehabilitated between April 1, 1980 
11 
and December 15, 1986; (b) a construction code official certifies, 
12 
based upon a visual exterior survey, that the unit is in compliance 
13 
with pertinent construction code standards with respect to structural 
14 
elements, roofing, siding, doors and windows; (c) the household 
15 
occupying the unit certifies in writing, under penalty of perjury, that

18 
moderate income housing; and (d) the unit for which credit is 
19 
sought is affordable to low and moderate income households under 
20 
the standards established by the council at the time of filing of the 
21 
petition for substantive certification.  It shall be sufficient if the 
22 
certification required in subparagraph (c) is signed by one member 
23 
of the household.  A certification submitted pursuant to this 
24 
paragraph shall be reviewable only by the council or its staff and 
25 
shall not be a public record[;] . 
26 
 
Nothing in P.L.1995, c.81 shall affect the validity of substantive 
27 
certification granted by the council prior to November 21, 1994, or 
28 
of a judgment of compliance entered by any court of competent 
29 
jurisdiction prior to that date.  Additionally, any municipality that 
30 
received substantive certification or a judgment of compliance prior 
31 
to November 21, 1994 and filed a motion prior to November 21, 
32 
1994 to amend substantive certification or a judgment of 
33 
compliance for the purpose of obtaining credits, shall be entitled to 
34 
a determination of its right to credits pursuant to the standards 
35 
established by the Legislature prior to P.L.1995, c.81.  Any 
36 
municipality that filed a motion prior to November 21, 1994 for the 
37 
purpose of obtaining credits, which motion was supported by the 
38 
results of a completed survey performed pursuant to council rules, 
39 
shall be entitled to a determination of its right to credits pursuant to 
40 
the standards established by the Legislature prior to P.L.1995, c.81; 
41 
 
(2) Municipal adjustment of the present and prospective fair 
42 
share based upon available vacant and developable land, 
43 
infrastructure 
considerations 
or 
environmental 
or 
historic 
44 
preservation factors and adjustments shall be made whenever: 
45 
 
(a) The preservation of historically or important architecture and 
46 
sites and their environs or environmentally sensitive lands may be 
47 
jeopardized, 
48

3 
and farmland preservation purposes would not be provided,

6 
designations in the State Development and Redevelopment Plan 
7 
prepared pursuant to sections 1 through 12 of P.L.1985, c.398 
8 
(C.52:18A-196 et seq.), 
9 
 
(f) Vacant and developable land is not available in the 
10 
municipality, and 
11 
 
(g) Adequate public facilities and infrastructure capacities are 
12 
not available, or would result in costs prohibitive to the public if 
13 
provided[.] ; 
14 
 
(3) (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1993, c.31)[.] 
15 
 
d. Provide population and household projections for the State 
16 
[and housing regions]; and 
17 
 
e. 
In its discretion, place a limit, based on a percentage of 
18 
existing housing stock in a municipality and any other criteria 
19 
including employment opportunities which the council deems 
20 
appropriate, upon the aggregate number of units which may be 
21 
allocated to a municipality as its fair share of the [region's] State’s 
22 
present and prospective need for low and moderate income housing.  
23 
No municipality shall be required to address a fair share of housing 
24 
units affordable to households with a gross household income of 
25 
less than 80% of the median gross household income beyond 1,000 
26 
units within ten years from the grant of substantive certification, 
27 
unless it is demonstrated, following objection by an interested party 
28 
and an evidentiary hearing, based upon the facts and circumstances 
29 
of the affected municipality that it is likely that the municipality 
30 
through its zoning powers could create a realistic opportunity for 
31 
more than 1,000 low and moderate income units within that ten-
32 
year period.  For the purposes of this section, the facts and 
33 
circumstances which shall determine whether a municipality's fair 
34 
share shall exceed 1,000 units, as provided above, shall be a finding 
35 
that the municipality has issued more than 5,000 certificates of 
36 
occupancy for residential units in the ten-year period preceding the 
37 
petition for substantive certification in connection with which the 
38 
objection was filed. 
39 
 
For the purpose of crediting low and moderate income housing 
40 
units in order to arrive at a determination of present and prospective 
41 
fair share, as set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this 
42 
section, housing units comprised in a community residence for the 
43 
developmentally disabled, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, 
44 
c.448 (C.30:11B-2), shall be fully credited pursuant to rules 
45 
promulgated or to be promulgated by the council, to the extent that 
46 
the units are affordable to persons of low and moderate income and 
47 
are available to the general public. 
48

The council [, with respect to any municipality seeking 
1 
substantive certification,] shall require that a minimum percentage 
2 
of housing units in any residential development resulting from a 
3 
zoning change made to a previously non-residentially-zoned 
4 
property, where the change in zoning precedes or follows the 
5 
application for residential development by no more than 24 months, 
6 
be reserved for occupancy by low or moderate income households, 
7 
which percentage shall be determined by the council based on 
8 
economic feasibility with consideration for the proposed density of 
9 
development. 
10 
 
In carrying out the above duties, including, but not limited to, 
11 
present and prospective need estimations the council shall give 
12 
appropriate weight to pertinent research studies, government 
13 
reports, decisions of other branches of government, implementation 
14 
of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan prepared 
15 
pursuant to sections 1 through 12 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 
16 
et seq.) and public comment.  To assist the council, the State 
17 
Planning Commission established under that act shall provide the 
18 
council annually with economic growth, development, and decline 
19 
projections for [each housing region] the State for the next ten 
20 
years.  The council shall develop procedures for periodically 
21 
adjusting [regional] the Statewide need based upon the low and 
22 
moderate income housing that is provided in the [region] State 
23 
through any federal, State, municipal or private housing program. 
24 
 
No housing unit subject to the provisions of section 5 of 
25 
P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-123.15) and to the provisions of the 
26 
barrier free subcode adopted by the Commissioner of Community 
27 
Affairs pursuant to the "State Uniform Construction Code Act," 
28 
P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) shall be eligible for 
29 
inclusion in the municipal fair share plan certified by the council 
30 
unless the unit complies with the requirements set forth thereunder.

9. a.  [Within four months after the effective date of this act, 
36 
each municipality which so elects shall, by a duly adopted

resolution of participation, notify the council of its intent to submit 
38 
to the council its fair share housing plan.]  Within five months after 
39

40 
and prospective fair share of the Statewide housing need in a 
41 
municipality, the municipality shall prepare and file with the

filing of the housing element], [petition] the council [for a 
13 
substantive certification of its element and ordinances or institute an

28 
filing, or within one year following the effective date of P.L.1990, 
29 
c.121, whichever shall result in permitting the municipality the

41 
petition and shall issue a substantive certification if it shall find 
42 
that:  
43

achievement 
of 
the 
6 
municipality's fair share of low and moderate income housing 
7 
realistically possible after allowing for the implementation of any

regional contribution agreement approved by the council. 
9 
 
In conducting its review, the council may meet with the

municipality and may deny the petition or condition its certification 
11 
upon changes in the element or ordinances.  Any denial or 
12 
conditions for approval shall be in writing and shall set forth the

petition with changes satisfactory to the council, the council shall 
16 
issue a substantive certification.] 
17

19 
municipality to satisfy the municipality’s fair share obligation.  
20 
Upon completion of the fair share plan, the council shall publish 
21 
notice of the plan on its Internet website and shall submit a copy to 
22 
the clerk of the municipality.  A municipality shall [have 45 days in 
23 
which to] adopt its fair share housing ordinance based on the fair 
24 
share plan approved by the council within 45 days of the 
25 
publication of the notice of the fair share plan, unless the plan is 
26 
subject to mediation pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1985, c.222 
27 
(C.52:27D-315), in which case the municipality shall adopt the

time specified in section 14 of this act; or (2) if a request for 
38 
mediation and review is made pursuant to section 16 of this act] 45

12. Section 33 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.2) is amended to 
1 
read as follows: 
2 
 
33. The Legislature finds and declares: 
3 
 
a. 
The collection of development fees from builders of 
4 
residential and non-residential properties has been authorized by the 
5 
court through the powers delegated to the Council on Affordable 
6 
Housing established pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, 
7 
c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). 
8 
 
b. New Jersey's land resources are becoming more scarce, 
9 
while its redevelopment needs are increasing.  In order to balance 
10 
the needs of developing and redeveloping communities, a 
11 
reasonable method of providing for the housing needs of low and 
12 
moderate income and middle income households, without 
13 
mandating the inclusion of housing in every non-residential project, 
14 
must be established. 
15 
 
c. 
A Statewide non-residential development fee program which 
16 
permits municipalities under the council's jurisdiction to retain 
17 
these fees for use in the municipality will provide a fair and 
18 
balanced funding method to address the State's affordable housing 
19 
needs[, while providing an incentive to all municipalities to seek 
20 
substantive certification from the council]. 
21 
 
d. Whereas pursuant to P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-1 et seq.), 
22 
organizations are directed to invest in the Casino Reinvestment 
23 
Development Authority to ensure that the development of housing 
24 
for families of low and moderate income shall be provided. The 
25 
Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, in consultation with 
26 
the council, shall work to effectuate the purpose and intent of 
27 
P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). 
28 
 
e. 
The "Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act," 
29 
sections 32 through 38 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.1 through 
30 
C.40:55D-8.7), prohibits municipalities from imposing their own 
31 
fees to fund affordable housing on non-residential development, and 
32 
P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-489a et al.) is not intended to alter this 
33 
underlying policy. 
34 
 
f. 
The negative impact of a State policy that over-relies on a 
35 
municipal fee structure and of State programs that require a 
36 
municipality to impose fees and charges on developers must be 
37 
balanced against any public good expected from such regulation.  It 
38 
is undisputable that the charging of fees at high levels dissuades 
39 
commerce from locating within a State or municipality or locality 
40 
and halts non-residential and residential development, and these ill 
41 
effects directly increase the overall costs of housing, and could 
42 
impede the constitutional obligation to provide for a realistic 
43 
opportunity for housing for families at all income levels. 
44 
(cf: P.L.2009, c.90, s.36)  
45 
 
46 
 
13. The following sections are repealed: 
47 
 
Section 16 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-316);

STATEMENT 
8 
 
9 
 
This bill would require that affordable housing obligations be 
10 
calculated and administered at the State level.  Affordable housing 
11 
is an issue of Statewide concern and importance.  It is also a highly 
12 
complex issue that requires technical expertise, often ends up in 
13 
litigation, and is expensive to administer.  This bill would eliminate 
14 
the current municipality-to-municipality patchwork approach to 
15 
affordable housing.  The bill would centralize administration of this 
16 
issue in the State agency with the necessary Statewide policy 
17 
perspective and technical expertise, and which can serve as a cost-
18 
effective, fair forum to address this issue – the Council on 
19 
Affordable Housing (the “council”). 
20 
 
Currently, affordable housing need is calculated at the regional 
21 
level and fair share plans are created by municipalities.  Under the 
22 
bill, the council would calculate the affordable housing need of the 
23 
entire State.  The council would then select which municipalities 
24 
will have a role to play in fulfilling this Statewide need and will 
25 
assign them a fair share of this obligation.  Such municipality would 
26 
then submit a housing element that provides basic information on 
27 
the current housing stock and properties suited for affordable 
28 
housing development that could satisfy the municipal fair share.  
29 
After receipt of the housing element, the bill requires the council to 
30 
grant the municipality a substantive certification that shields it from 
31 
exclusionary zoning suits.  The council would next draft a fair share 
32 
plan for the municipality that directs the municipality on how to 
33 
satisfy its fair share obligation.  The municipality would be required 
34 
to adopt a fair share ordinance effectuating that fair share plan. 
35 
 
The council would be required to engage in a mediation process 
36 
if an objection is made to its fair share plan for a municipality.  Any 
37 
exclusionary zoning suit to a fair share plan for a municipality 
38 
would have to be brought against the council, with the municipality 
39 
having the option to be a party in the litigation.
