e. 
(1)  The commissioner shall be authorized to assess a civil 
18 
administrative penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than 
19 
$10,000 for each violation, provided that each day during which the 
20 
violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and 
21 
distinct offense.  In assessing a civil administrative penalty, the 
22 
commissioner shall consider the severity of the violation, the 
23 
measures taken to prevent further violations, and whether the 
24 
penalty will act as an appropriate deterrent.  
25 
 
(2) Prior to the assessment of a civil administrative penalty 
26 
under this subsection, the person committing the violation shall be

administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the 
32 
alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall have 35 days 
33 
from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the 
34 
commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and 
35 
upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may 
36 
issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in 
37 
the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a 
38 
final order after the expiration of the 35-day period.  Payment of the 
39 
assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes 
40 
a final order.   
41 
 
(3) The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to 
42 
all other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of any 
43 
assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any 
44 
other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for 
45 
which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise 
46 
any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an 
47 
amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate.

STATEMENT 
29 
 
30 
 
This bill would require the producers of plastic packaging and 
31 
certain other plastic products sold in the State to reduce the amount, 
32 
by weight, of their packaging or products sold annually.  The bill 
33 
would also restrict additional substances under the "Toxic 
34 
Packaging Reduction Act," P.L.1991, c.520 (C.13:1E-99.44 et seq.). 
35 
 
Specifically, the source reduction component of the bill would 
36 
apply to (1) plastic packaging, (2) single-use plastic products that 
37 
are collected in the municipal solid waste stream, and (3) plastic 
38 
products that have the effect of disrupting recycling processes, 
39 
including, but not limited to, single-use plastic items such as straws, 
40 
utensils, cups, plates, and plastic bags.  The definition of "covered 
41 
material" in section 1 of the bill would exclude various types of 
42 
products, including those regulated under certain federal laws.  
43 
Under the bill, producers of the products described above (including 
44 
producers of products that are packaged in plastic packaging) would 
45 
be required to decrease the amount of the packaging or products 
46 
that are sold annually, by weight, such that, after two years, the 
47 
quantity sold is 90 percent of the baseline amount, after four years, 
48

the quantity sold is 80 percent of the baseline amount, after six 
1 
years, the quantity sold is 70 percent of the baseline amount, after 
2 
eight years, the quantity sold is 60 percent of the baseline amount, 
3 
and, after 10 years, the quantity sold is 50 percent of the baseline 
4 
amount. 
5 
 
The bill would also prohibit the sale of cardboard packaging 
6 
materials (including products sold in cardboard packaging 
7 
materials) unless the cardboard contains at least 75 percent 
8 
postconsumer recycled content and is recycled at a rate of at least 
9 
75 percent.  Producers who violate these requirements would be 
10 
liable to civil and civil administrative penalties of up to $10,000 per 
11 
day of noncompliance. 
12 
 
The bill would also amend the "Toxic Packaging Reduction Act" 
13 
to prohibit the sale of packaging (and products that are packaged in 
14 
packaging) that contains certain substances, including toxic metals, 
15 
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and vinyl chloride.  
16 
Under current law, only packaging that contains lead, mercury, 
17 
cadmium, or hexavalent chromium is restricted under the "Toxic 
18 
Packaging Reduction Act."  Persons who violate the provisions of 
19 
the "Toxic Packaging Reduction Act" are liable to civil and civil 
20 
administrative penalties of up to $7,500 per day of noncompliance, 
21 
for a first offense.  
22 
 
Finally, the bill would also establish a Toxic Packaging Task 
23 
Force, composed of the DEP commissioner or a designee and four 
24 
members of the public, appointed by the DEP commission and the 
25 
presiding officers of the Legislature.  The task force would be 
26 
charged with recommending additional chemicals to regulate under 
27 
the "Toxic Packaging Reduction Act."  Under the bill, the DEP 
28 
would be required to adopt rules and regulations to regulate a 
29 
chemical no later than one year after the task force's 
30 
recommendation.
