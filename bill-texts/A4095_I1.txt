13 
valid for a period of 90 days from the date of issuance and may be 
14 
renewed by the issuing authority for good cause for an additional 90 
15

31 
person aggrieved by the denial of an application for renewal of a

35 
county in which the person's application was filed if the person is a 
36 
nonresident.  The request for a hearing shall be made in writing 
37 
within 30 days of the denial of the application for renewal of the

39 
permit in the form required under the process established by the 
40 
superintendent, and the seller shall complete all of the information

the superintendent through the web portal, or in such other manner 
43 
as may be authorized by the superintendent, and to the chief police 
44

35 
reputable persons also shall provide relevant information supporting

22 
a complete description of each handgun the applicant intends to 
23 
carry.  The chief police officer, the county sheriff, or the 
24

25 
the persons endorsing the application under subsection b. of this 
26

27 
extent warranted, whether the applicant is likely to engage in 
28 
conduct that would result in harm to the applicant or others, 
29 
including, but not limited to, whether the applicant has any history 
30 
of threats or acts of violence by the applicant directed toward self or

37 
experiencing any mental health issues such as suicidal ideation or 
38 
violent impulses, and the applicant's use of drugs or alcohol. 
39 
 
The chief police officer, the county sheriff, or the superintendent 
40 
may require such other information from the applicant or any other

42 
posted or published online by the applicant, as the chief police 
43 
officer or superintendent deems reasonably necessary to conduct the 
44 
review of the application.  
45 
 
An application shall not be approved by the chief police officer, 
46 
the county sheriff or the superintendent unless the applicant 
47 
demonstrates that the applicant is not subject to any of the 
48

7 
officer, the county sheriff, or the superintendent, if it is not 
8 
approved or denied by the chief police officer, the county sheriff, or

the superintendent within 90 days of filing, it shall be deemed to 
10 
have been approved; provided, however, the chief police officer or 
11 
the superintendent may, for good cause shown and upon written 
12 
notification to the applicant, extend by up to an additional 30 days 
13 
the time period for which the application may be approved or 
14 
denied.  The written notification sent to the applicant shall provide 
15

STATEMENT 
32 
 
33 
 
This bill provides county sheriffs with the authority to issue 
34 
firearms purchaser identification cards and permits to purchase 
35 
handguns, and provides them with authority to accept applications 
36 
for permits to carry handguns. 
37 
 
Under current law, a State resident applying for a firearms 
38 
purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun 
39 
must make such application to the chief law enforcement officer of 
40 
an organized full-time police department of the municipality where 
41 
the applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police if the 
42 
municipality does not have a full-time police force.  Out-of-State 
43 
residents must make application to the superintendent.  The chief 
44 
law enforcement officer, or superintendent, as the case may be, is 
45 
tasked with taking fingerprints and initiating a criminal history 
46 
records check on the applicant.  Upon completion of the 
47 
background investigation, the applicant is issued the identification 
48

19 
 
 
card or permit by the chief law enforcement officer or 
1 
superintendent.  Under the provisions of this bill, county sheriffs 
2 
are granted the same authority for State residents. 
3 
 
In the instance of an application for a permit to carry a handgun, 
4 
the initial application process is similar under current law.  An 
5 
applicant must make application to the chief law enforcement 
6 
officer of an organized full-time police department of the 
7 
municipality where the applicant resides or the Superintendent of 
8 
State Police if the municipality does not have a full-time police 
9 
force.  Out-of-State residents and employees of armored trucks must 
10 
make application to the superintendent.  Upon approval of the 
11 
application by the chief law enforcement officer, or superintendent, 
12 
the Superior Court issues the permit.  The bill provides county 
13 
sheriffs with the authority to accept, investigate and approve or 
14 
deny permit to carry applications for State residents.
