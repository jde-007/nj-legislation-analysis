BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State 
4 
of New Jersey: 
5 
 
6 
 
1. The Legislature finds and declares that: 
7 
 
a. 
The deployment of small wireless facilities and other next-
8 
generation wireless and broadband network facilities is a matter of 
9 
federal and statewide concern and interest; 
10 
 
b. Wireless and broadband products and services are a 
11 
significant and continually growing part of the State’s economy and 
12 
encouraging the development of strong and robust wireless and 
13 
broadband communications networks throughout the State is 
14 
integral to the State’s economic competitiveness; 
15 
 
c. 
Rapid deployment of small wireless facilities will serve 
16 
important Statewide goals, such as: meeting the growing consumer 
17 
demand for wireless data; increasing competitive options for 
18 
communications services available to the State’s residents; 
19 
promoting the ability of the State’s residents to communicate with 
20 
their neighbors and with their State and local governments; and 
21 
promoting public safety; 
22 
 
d. Small wireless facilities, including facilities commonly 
23 
referred to as small cells and distributed antenna systems, are most 
24 
cost-effective for a wireless service provider when deployed  in 
25 
rights-of-way; 
26 
 
e. 
To 
meet 
the 
key 
objectives 
of 
federal 
law 
and 
27 
P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), 
28 
wireless providers must be granted access to rights-of-way and have 
29 
the ability to attach to infrastructure in rights-of-way on a 
30 
competitively neutral basis to densify wireless networks and to 
31 
provide next-generation wireless services; 
32 
 
f. 
Rates and fees for the permitting and deployment of small 
33 
wireless facilities in rights-of-way and on authority infrastructure, 
34 
including utility poles, throughout the State, consistent with federal 
35 
law, is reasonable and will encourage the development of robust 
36 
next-generation wireless and broadband networks for the benefit of 
37 
residents throughout the State; 
38 
 
g. Authorities actively manage rights-of-way, acting as trustees 
39 
of this limited public asset, to protect residents’ safety, preserve the 
40 
character of communities, and maintain availability for current and 
41 
future uses; and 
42 
 
h. The 
procedures, 
rates, 
and 
fees 
established 
in 
43 
P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) 
44 
should be consistent with federal law and are fair, reasonable, and 
45 
further the State’s interest in facilitating and supporting a robust, 
46 
reliable, and technologically-advanced wireless and broadband 
47 
network and reflect a balancing of the interests of the wireless

expense, the following insurance: 
35 
 
(1) property insurance for its property’s replacement cost

45 
certification and documentation of inclusion of the authority in a 
46

STATEMENT 
18 
 
19 
 
This bill provides for the uniform regulation of small wireless 
20 
facility deployment in the State by the State government and local 
21 
government units (authorities). The bill prohibits an authority from 
22 
regulating small wireless facilities in a manner inconsistent with the 
23 
bill, including entering into an exclusive arrangement with any person 
24 
or entity for the use of the right-of-way for: 
25 
 
1) the collocation of a small wireless facility;  
26 
 
2) the mounting or installation of a small wireless facility on new 
27 
or replacement poles;  
28 
 
3) the installation of associated antenna equipment adjacent to a 
29 
structure on which a small wireless facility is or will be collocated, 
30 
mounted, or installed; or 
31 
 
4) the 
installation, 
operation, 
marketing, 
modification, 
32 
maintenance, or replacement of associated poles.   
33 
 
The bill provides that a wireless provider, as defined in the bill, is 
34 
to have the right, as a permitted use not subject to zoning review or 
35 
approval, and without the need for authority consent to: 
36 
 
1) collocate small wireless facilities;  
37 
 
2) mount or install small wireless facilities on new or replacement 
38 
poles;  
39 
 
3) install associated antenna equipment adjacent to a structure on 
40 
which a small wireless facility is or will be collocated, mounted, or 
41 
installed; or  
42 
 
4) install, modify, or replace its own poles, or, with the 
43 
permission of the owner, a third party’s poles, associated with a small 
44 
wireless facility, along, across, upon, and under the right-of-way.  
45 
 
The bill provides that each new, replaced, or modified pole 
46 
installed in the right-of-way for the purpose of collocating, mounting, 
47 
or installing a small wireless facility is to follow certain height 
48 


=== Page 20 ===
 
S2324 BEACH 
20 
 
 
restrictions pursuant to the bill. A wireless provider is not to install a 
1 
new pole unless the wireless provider has determined it cannot meet its 
2 
service objectives by collocating on existing poles or structures. An 
3 
authority may adopt aesthetics requirements governing the deployment 
4 
of small wireless facilities and associated antenna equipment and poles 
5 
in the right-of-way, subject to certain requirements pursuant to the bill. 
6 
A wireless provider is to comply with undergrounding requirements 
7 
that are consistent with the bill.  
8 
 
The bill requires a wireless provider to repair all damage to the 
9 
right-of-way caused by the activities of the wireless provider and to 
10 
return the right-of-way to its functional and aesthetic equivalence 
11 
before the damage, pursuant to the competitively neutral, reasonable 
12 
requirements, and specifications of the authority. If the wireless 
13 
provider fails to make the repairs required by the authority within a 
14 
reasonable time after written notice, the authority may make those 
15 
repairs and charge the applicable party the reasonable documented cost 
16 
of the repairs. 
17 
 
Under the bill, a wireless provider is not required to replace or 
18 
upgrade an existing pole, except for reasons of structural necessity or 
19 
compliance with applicable building codes. A wireless provider may, 
20 
with the permission of the pole owner, replace or modify the existing 
21 
pole, but any replacement or modification is to be consistent with the 
22 
design aesthetics of the pole being modified or replaced. The bill 
23 
requires wireless provider to notify an authority at least 30 days before 
24 
the abandonment of a small wireless facility located within the 
25 
authority’s jurisdiction. Following receipt of the notice, the authority is 
26 
to direct the wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the small 
27 
wireless facility and associated antenna equipment that the authority 
28 
determines would be in the best interest of the public. If the wireless 
29 
provider fails to remove the abandoned small wireless facility within 
30 
90 days after the notice, the authority may undertake to remove the 
31 
small wireless facility and recover the actual and reasonable expenses 
32 
of the removal from the wireless provider, its successors, or assigns.   
33 
 
The bill allows an authority to require an applicant to obtain a 
34 
permit for:  
35 
 
1) the collocation of a small wireless facility;  
36 
 
2) the mounting or installation of a small wireless facility on a 
37 
new, modified, or replacement pole; or  
38 
 
3) the installation, modification, or replacement of a pole or 
39 
antenna equipment as provided in the bill. 
40 
 
Each permit issued pursuant to the bill is to be of general 
41 
applicability and is not to apply exclusively to a small wireless facility 
42 
and an authority is to receive and process applications following 
43 
certain requirements pursuant to the bill. Application fees for any 
44 
permit issued pursuant to the bill are not to exceed certain amounts 
45 
pursuant to the bill. 
46 
 
Under the bill, the rates, fees, and terms and conditions for any 
47 
make-ready work to collocate, mount, or install a small wireless 
48

21 
 
 
facility on an authority pole and to install associated antenna 
1 
equipment are to be non-discriminatory, competitively neutral, 
2 
commercially reasonable, and are in compliance with the provisions of 
3 
the bill. The bill further provides that all rates and fees established 
4 
pursuant to the bill are to be a reasonable approximation of the 
5 
authority’s reasonable costs, and are to be applied by the authority in a 
6 
non-discriminatory manner. An authority may not require a wireless 
7 
provider to pay any rates, fees, or compensation to the authority or 
8 
other person other than what is expressly authorized by the bill for the 
9 
right to use or occupy the right-of-way for the collocation, mounting, 
10 
or installation of a small wireless facility on a pole in the right-of-way, 
11 
or for the installation, maintenance, modification, or replacement of 
12 
associated antenna equipment or a pole in the right-of-way. 
13 
 
The bill provides that an authority is not to have or exercise any 
14 
jurisdiction or authority over the design, engineering, construction, 
15 
installation, or operation of a small wireless facility located in an 
16 
interior structure or upon the site of a campus, stadium, or athletic 
17 
facility not owned or controlled by the authority, other than to require 
18 
compliance with applicable building codes. Further, except as it relates 
19 
to small wireless facilities subject to the permit and fee requirements 
20 
established pursuant the bill or otherwise specifically authorized by 
21 
State or federal law, an authority is not to adopt or enforce any 
22 
regulations or requirements on the placement or operation of 
23 
communications facilities in the right-of-way by a communications 
24 
service provider authorized by federal, State, or local law to operate in 
25 
the right-of-way, regulate any communications services, or impose or 
26 
collect any tax, fee, rate, or charge for the provision of additional 
27 
communications service over the communications service provider’s 
28 
communications facilities in the right-of-way.  
29 
 
The bill allows an authority to adopt an ordinance that makes 
30 
available to wireless providers rates, fees, and other terms and 
31 
conditions that comply with the provisions of the bill. In the absence 
32 
of an ordinance, a wireless provider may install and operate a small 
33 
wireless facility and any associated poles and antenna equipment 
34 
under the requirements of the bill. An authority may not require a 
35 
wireless provider to enter into an agreement to implement the 
36 
provisions of the bill, but agreements are permissible if voluntary and 
37 
non-discriminatory. 
38 
 
The bill provides that an authority may adopt reasonable 
39 
indemnification, insurance, and bonding requirements related to a 
40 
small wireless facility and associated pole permits and antenna 
41 
equipment.  The bill requires a wireless provider that owns or operates 
42 
a small wireless facility or utility pole in the right-of-way to 
43 
indemnify, protect, defend, and hold the authority and its elected 
44 
officials, officers, and employees, agents, and volunteers harmless 
45 
against all claims, lawsuits, judgements, costs, liens, losses, expenses, 
46 
and fees. 
47

The bill further provides that an authority may require a wireless 
1 
provider to have in effect certain insurance coverage as provided in the 
2 
bill. The bill also allows an authority to impose reasonable and non-
3 
discriminatory requirements for bonds, escrow deposits, letters of 
4 
credit, or any other type of financial surety to ensure removal of 
5 
abandoned or unused wireless facilities or damage to the right-of-way 
6 
or authority property caused by the wireless provider or its agent. 
7 
 
The bill provides that nothing in the bill is to be construed to 
8 
authorize certain actions, including authorizing a person to collocate a 
9 
small wireless facility on property owned by a public utility without 
10 
consent of the public utility, to impact, modify or supersede any 
11 
construction standard or other obligation applicable to certain entities 
12 
that are not wireless providers, or to apply to a public utility’s use of 
13 
its own poles, facilities, or both for communications associated with its 
14 
public utility operations.  
15 
 
The bill provides that a court of competent jurisdiction is to have 
16 
jurisdiction to determine disputes arising pursuant to the bill. A dispute 
17 
is to be pursued in accordance with accelerated docket or complaint 
18 
procedures, where available.
