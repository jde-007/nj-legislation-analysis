STATEMENT 
19 
 
20 
 
This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection 
21 
(DEP), in consultation with the Drinking Water Quality Institute, to 
22 
establish a definition of the term “microplastics,” and a standard 
23 
methodology to be used by public water systems in the testing of 
24 
drinking water for microplastics.  The DEP would be required to 
25 
establish requirements for the testing and reporting of the 
26 
concentration of microplastics in drinking water for a four year period 
27 
by public water systems, and the public disclosure of test results.  In 
28 
addition, the DEP would be required to establish criteria to accredit 
29 
qualified laboratories in New Jersey to analyze microplastics.   
30 
 
The bill also requires the DEP and the Board of Public Utilities 
31 
(BPU) to commence a study to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of 
32 
the use of microplastics removal technologies by system owners or 
33 
operators to remove microplastics from drinking water and wastewater 
34 
in the State.  In conducting the study, the DEP and BPU would 
35 
cooperatively engage in a stakeholder engagement process, which 
36 
shall include consultation with, and the solicitation of testimony and 
37 
information from: (1) experts in the operation of water supply, water 
38 
treatment, or wastewater collection or treatment systems; the operation 
39 
of water filtering systems or removal technologies; the proper handling 
40 
or disposal of microplastics; or the study or remediation of water 
41 
pollution or contaminants; (2) marine biologists, oceanographers, 
42 
water quality specialists, environmental scientists, toxicologists, public 
43 
health experts, and other members of appropriate scientific fields; and 
44 
(3) representatives of the plastics manufacturing industry; (4) members 
45 
of the public; and (5) other relevant and interested parties. 
46 
 
The bill would also require the DEP and BPU to authorize system 
47 
owners or operators in the State to engage in pilot microplastics 
48

6 
 
 
removal projects, with associated pilot project data to be included in 
1 
the study.  The bill would require the DEP to solicit and approve 
2 
applications for, and take other appropriate action to facilitate, the 
3 
implementation of pilot projects.   
4 
 
No later than three months after completion of the study, the BPU 
5 
would be required to prepare and submit a written report to the 
6 
Governor and to the Legislature, identifying the findings from the 
7 
study, and providing recommendations for legislative, executive, and 
8 
other actions that can be taken to facilitate, encourage, and promote 
9 
the increased use of microplastics removal technologies in the State.  
10 
At a minimum, the report would include a strategic plan for the 
11 
deployment and use of microplastics removal technologies.  Following 
12 
the submission of the report, the DEP and BPU would be required to 
13 
engage in an ongoing, cooperative public education and awareness 
14 
campaign in order to inform system owners or operators and members 
15 
of the public about the dangers posed by microplastics, the importance 
16 
of removing microplastics from drinking water and waste water, the 
17 
technologies available on the market to remove microplastics from 
18 
water, and the goals and primary elements of the strategic plan.
