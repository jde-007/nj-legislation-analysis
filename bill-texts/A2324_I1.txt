AN ACT concerning the inclusion, in hazard mitigation plans, of 
1 
climate change-related threat assessments and hazard prevention 
2 
and mitigation strategies, and supplementing chapter 9 of 
3 
Appendix A.

BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State 
6 
of New Jersey:

1. a.  As used in this section,  
9 
 
“FEMA” means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  
10 
 
“Hazard mitigation plan” means a plan adopted at the State or 
11 
county level which identifies the natural hazard risks and 
12 
vulnerabilities in the State or locality, describes the hazard 
13 
mitigation strategies to be used by the State or locality in addressing 
14 
such risks and vulnerabilities, is approved by the Federal 
15 
Emergency Management Agency, and is required in order for the 
16 
State or local government to apply for and obtain certain types of 
17 
emergency disaster assistance under the federal “Robert T. Stafford 
18 
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act,” Pub.L.100-707 (42 
19 
U.S.C. s.5121 et seq.). 
20 
 
 “Social vulnerability” means the susceptibility of social groups 
21 
to 
the 
adverse 
impacts 
of 
natural 
hazards, 
including 
22 
disproportionate death, injury, loss, or disruption of livelihood. 
23 
 
“System asset” means a resource of value requiring protection, 
24 
which resource can be tangible, such as a building, facility, 
25 
equipment, activity, or operation, or intangible, such as processes or 
26 
information. 
27 
 
b. A hazard mitigation plan that is adopted or revised by the 
28 
State Office of Emergency Management in the Division of State 
29 
Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety, or by a county 
30 
office of emergency management, on or after the effective date of 
31 
this act, shall address the current and future impacts of climate 
32 
change, identify the specific hazards and risks associated with 
33 
climate change, and include strategies to prevent and mitigate the 
34 
impacts of climate change on the natural hazards identified through 
35 
the planning process.  Each hazard mitigation plan shall, at a 
36 
minimum: 
37 
 
(1) identify and analyze the existing and future threats to, and 
38 
vulnerabilities of, system assets, which threats and vulnerabilities 
39 
are resulting, or are likely to result, from natural hazards either 
40 
caused or worsened by climate change;  
41 
 
(2)  identify the critical facilities, utilities, roadways, and other 
42 
types of infrastructure, including, but not limited to, elements 
43 
identified and consistent with FEMA community guidance for 
44 
fundamental essential community functions and services in the State 
45 
or county, as the case may be, that are necessary for evacuation 
46 
purposes, for sustaining assets and systems that protect life and 
47 
property during a natural disaster, or for facilitating rapid recovery 
48

after a natural disaster; describe the specific climate change-related 
1 
threats and vulnerabilities, identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of 
2 
this subsection, that are likely to affect each type of infrastructure, 
3 
particularly when located in a riparian or coastal flood zone or other 
4 
low-lying area;  
5 
 
 (3) include  a social vulnerability assessment that evaluates 
6 
whether, how, and to what extent, socially vulnerable and 
7 
underserved communities within the State or county, as the case 
8 
may be, are or may be disproportionately impacted by the existing 
9 
and future threats, vulnerabilities, and hazards identified pursuant to 
10 
paragraph (1) of this subsection and the current and future effects of 
11 
climate change on system assets and critical infrastructure, as 
12 
identified pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.  The 
13 
social vulnerability assessment shall include, but shall not be 
14 
limited to, an evaluation as to whether, how, and to what extent 
15 
minority, low-income, and other historically disadvantaged, 
16 
underserved or marginalized communities are or may be 
17 
disproportionately impacted, in particular, by natural hazards such 
18 
as increased flooding and the development of heat islands;  
19 
 
 (4)  include an assessment as to whether, how, and to what 
20 
extent, the threats and vulnerabilities identified pursuant to 
21 
paragraph (1) of this subsection will impact the State’s or county’s  
22 
ability, over time, to successfully implement other components of 
23 
its hazard mitigation plan;  
24 
 
 (5) describe the proactive and preventive means, methods, 
25 
strategies, procedures, protocols, and design and building standards 
26 
that will be used by the State or county, as the case may be, to:  (a) 
27 
eliminate or reduce the threats and vulnerabilities identified 
28 
pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection; (b) mitigate the 
29 
hazardous impacts of climate change, particularly in areas subject to 
30 
flooding; and (c) mitigate the disproportionate impacts of natural 
31 
hazards on socially vulnerable communities; and 
32 
 
 (6) describe the means, methods, strategies, procedures, 
33 
protocols, and design and building standards that will be used by 
34 
the State or county, as the case may be, to promptly and effectively 
35 
mitigate or offset the effects of natural hazards occurring in the 
36 
State or county, as appropriate. 
37 
 
c. 
The climate change-related assessments and strategies that 
38 
are incorporated into a hazard mitigation plan, pursuant to this 
39 
section, shall be based on the most recent natural hazard projections 
40 
and best available science.  
41 
 
d. The provisions of a floodplain management plan, emergency 
42 
operations plan, post-disaster recovery plan, capital improvement 
43 
plan, or other similar plan that is adopted or revised by the State, 
44 
county, or local government or other local jurisdiction as the case 
45 
may be, on or after the effective date of this act, shall be consistent 
46 
with, and shall reflect, the natural hazard risks of the applicable 
47

STATEMENT 
14 
 
15 
 
This bill would require any hazard mitigation plan (HMP) that is 
16 
adopted or revised on or after the date the bill is enacted into law, 
17 
either by the State Office of Emergency Management (OEM) or by a 
18 
county office of emergency management, to address the current and 
19 
future impacts of climate change, identify the specific hazards and 
20 
risks associated with climate change, and include strategies to prevent 
21 
and mitigate the impacts of climate change on the natural hazards 
22 
identified through the planning process. 
23 
 
The bill would require each HMP, among other things, to: 
24 
 
(1) identify and analyze the existing and future threats to, and 
25 
vulnerabilities of, resources of value including buildings, facilities, and 
26 
equipment, which result from natural hazards that are caused or 
27 
worsened by climate change;  
28 
 
(2) identify the critical facilities, utilities, roadways, and other 
29 
types of infrastructure that are necessary for evacuation, for sustaining 
30 
assets and systems that protect life and property during a natural 
31 
disaster, or for facilitating rapid recovery after a natural disaster;  
32 
 
(3) include a social vulnerability assessment that evaluates how, 
33 
and to what extent, socially vulnerable and underserved communities 
34 
may be disproportionately impacted by climate change-related natural 
35 
hazards;  
36 
 
(4) include an assessment as to whether, how, and to what extent, 
37 
identified climate change-related threats and vulnerabilities will 
38 
impact the State’s or county’s ability, over time, to successfully 
39 
implement other components of its HMP;  
40 
 
(5) describe the proactive and preventive means, methods, 
41 
strategies, procedures, protocols, and design and building standards 
42 
that will be used under the HMP to eliminate or reduce climate 
43 
change-related threats and vulnerabilities, to mitigate the hazardous 
44 
impacts of climate change, and to mitigate the impacts of climate 
45 
change on socially vulnerable communities; and 
46

(6) describe the means, methods, strategies, procedures, protocols, 
1 
and design and building standards that will be used under the HMP to 
2 
remediate or off-set the effects of natural hazards. 
3 
 
The bill requires the climate change-related components of an 
4 
HMP to be based on the most recent natural hazard projections and 
5 
best available science.  Finally, the bill further requires the provisions 
6 
of a floodplain management plan, emergency response plan, post-
7 
disaster recovery plan, capital improvement plan, or similar plan, 
8 
which is adopted or revised by the State, a county, or a local 
9 
government or other local jurisdiction on or after the date the bill is 
10 
enacted into law, to be consistent with, and to reflect, the natural 
11 
hazard risks of the applicable HMP.
