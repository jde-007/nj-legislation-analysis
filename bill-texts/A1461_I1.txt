AN ACT concerning the financing of climate change mitigation and 
1 
resilience projects, amending and supplementing P.L.1985, c.334, 
2 
and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes.   
3

BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State 
5 
of New Jersey: 
6 
 
7 
 
1. Section 2 of P.L.1985, c.334 (C.58:11B-2) is amended to read 
8 
as follows: 
9 
 
2. a.  The Legislature finds that the steady deterioration of older 
10 
sewage and sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants 
11 
endangers the availability and quality of uncontaminated water 
12 
resources of the State, thereby posing a grave danger to the health, 
13 
safety and welfare of the residents of the concerned communities and 
14 
the State; that the construction, rehabilitation, operation, and 
15 
maintenance of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater 
16 
treatment plants are essential to protecting and improving the State's 
17 
water quality; that in addition to protecting and improving water 
18 
quality, adequate wastewater treatment systems are essential to 
19 
economic growth and development; that many of the wastewater 
20 
treatment systems in New Jersey must be replaced or upgraded if an 
21 
inexorable decline in water quality is to be avoided during the coming 
22 
decades; that the United States Congress in recognition of the crucial 
23 
role wastewater treatment systems and plants play in maintaining and 
24 
improving water quality, and with an understanding that the cost of 
25 
financing and constructing these systems must be borne by local 
26 
governments and authorities with limited sources of revenues, 
27 
established in the “Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments 
28 
of 1972,” Pub.L.92-500 (33 U.S.C. s.1251 et al.) a program to 
29 
provide local governments with grants for constructing these 
30 
systems; that during the last several years the amount of federal grant 
31 
money available to states and local governments for assistance in 
32 
constructing and improving wastewater treatment systems has 
33 
sharply diminished; that the current level of federal grant funding is 
34 
inadequate to meet the cost of upgrading the State's wastewater 
35 
treatment capacity to comply with State water quality standards; that 
36 
the collective needs of the State and local governments for capital 
37 
financing of wastewater treatment systems far exceed the sums of 
38 
money presently available through revenue initiatives and State and 
39 
federal aid programs; and that it is fitting and proper for the State to 
40 
encourage local governments to undertake wastewater treatment 
41 
projects through the establishment of a State mechanism to provide 
42 
loans at the lowest reasonable interest rates and to guarantee or insure 
43 
local capital improvement bonds. 
44 
 
b. The Legislature finds that stormwater runoff and combined 
45 
sewer overflows are among the major sources of ocean pollution, 
46 


=== Page 3 ===
 
A1461 KARABINCHAK, KENNEDY 
3 
 
 
contributing to beach closings; that combined sewer systems 
1 
discharge untreated wastewater and stormwater into rivers, streams 
2 
and coastal waters during wet weather, resulting in water pollution; 
3 
that some combined sewer systems have deteriorated to the point that 
4 
overflows occur regularly, even during dry weather; that many sewer 
5 
systems are on inadequate repair and replacement programs, which 
6 
may cause disturbances at sewage treatment plants; that many 
7 
municipalities are under building moratoriums due to the inadequacy 
8 
of their sewage and stormwater collection systems, which severely 
9 
affect municipal budgets; and that large unmet capital expenses exist 
10 
for combined sewer system separation and abatement projects. 
11 
 
The Legislature further finds that funding at the federal level for 
12 
wastewater treatment, stormwater management and combined sewer 
13 
system rehabilitation projects is insufficient; that State funds 
14 
available for these projects are inadequate to meet current needs; that 
15 
local revenues are insufficient to meet these expenses; and that 
16 
additional funding at the State level is necessary to meet this financial 
17 
obligation. 
18 
 
c. 
The Legislature finds that construction, rehabilitation, 
19 
operation and maintenance of modern and efficient water supply 
20 
facilities are essential to protecting and improving the State's water 
21 
quality; that the citizens of this State, in recognition of the crucial 
22 
role the construction of new and the upgrading of existing water 
23 
supply facilities play in maintaining and augmenting the natural 
24 
water resources of the State, and with an understanding that the cost 
25 
of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited 
26 
financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities 
27 
and must be subsidized by the State and repaid through a system of 
28 
water supply user charges, approved the enactment of the “Water 
29 
Supply Bond Act of 1981” (P.L.1981, c.261); that the water supply 
30 
needs of the State are so great that the funds allocated for this purpose 
31 
from the “Water Supply Fund” established by that 1981 bond act 
32 
should be augmented and maximized, to the extent practicable, 
33 
through the use of alternative methods of State financing to offset the 
34 
costs of water supply projects and for the construction of new or the 
35 
rehabilitation of antiquated or inadequate existing water supply 
36 
facilities; that the United States Congress in recognition of the 
37 
essential role that safe drinking water plays in protecting the public 
38 
health, and with an understanding that financing, constructing and 
39 
maintaining water systems that meet the requirements of the “Safe 
40 
Drinking Water Act,” 42 U.S.C. s.300f et seq. exceed the financial 
41 
and technical capacity of the operators of some water systems, has 
42 
established in the “Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996,” 
43 
P.L.104-182, a program to provide public water systems with 
44 
financial assistance to meet national primary drinking water 
45 
regulations or to otherwise further the health protection objectives of 
46 
the federal law and that the State must, in order to make use of the 
47 
federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, 
48 


=== Page 4 ===
 
A1461 KARABINCHAK, KENNEDY 
4 
 
 
State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial 
1 
obligation. 
2 
 
d. The Legislature finds that the transportation infrastructure of 
3 
the State is among the most heavily used in the nation and has 
4 
deteriorated in recent years, with parts of the highway system 
5 
reaching the end of their useful lives. 
6 
 
e. 
The Legislature finds that capital projects for roadways and 
7 
bridges are essential to protecting and improving the State's 
8 
transportation system; that construction of new and the upgrading of 
9 
existing roadways and bridges play a critical role in the transportation 
10 
needs of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of 
11 
financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited 
12 
financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities 
13 
and must be subsidized by the State and Federal government; that the 
14 
United States Congress has established “State Infrastructure Bank” 
15 
programs 
to 
provide 
funding 
for 
transportation 
systems  
16 
(23 U.S.C. s.610) and that the State must, in order to make use of the 
17 
federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, 
18 
State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial 
19 
obligation. 
20 
 
f. 
The Legislature finds that there is universal scientific 
21 
consensus that human activity is the primary cause of climate change 
22 
over the past century; that climate change is causing sea levels to rise 
23 
and more frequent droughts, hurricanes, and other extreme weather 
24 
events that threaten public health, safety, the environment, and 
25 
critical infrastructure in the State; that, in order to mitigate the effects 
26 
of climate change, New Jersey must drastically reduce its fossil fuel 
27 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which, in turn, requires 
28 
the State to increase the pace and amount of investment in clean 
29 
energy, energy efficiency, and other climate change mitigation 
30 
projects; that the State must simultaneously take measures to protect 
31 
its residents, the environment, and critical infrastructure from the 
32 
adverse effects of climate change; that providing low-interest 
33 
financing for climate change mitigation and resilience projects will 
34 
improve the standard of living for New Jersey residents by delivering 
35 
clean energy more efficiently and at lower cost, and creating long-
36 
term, high paying jobs; and that such financing will also ease the 
37 
economic effects of transitioning from a carbon-based economy to a 
38 
clean energy economy.  
39 
 
g.  The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public 
40 
interest to establish a State authority authorized to issue bonds, notes 
41 
and other obligations and to establish any reserve funds necessary 
42 
therefor, and to make loans to and guarantee debt incurred by local 
43 
government units for environmental and transportation infrastructure 
44 
projects , and to provide loans and other financial assistance for 
45 
climate change mitigation and resilience projects.

1

6 
shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment, but

With respect to those public members first appointed by the 
9 
Governor, the appointment of each of the two members upon the 
10 
advice and consent of the Senate shall become effective 30 days after 
11 
their nomination by the Governor if the Senate has not given advice 
12 
and consent on those nominations within that time period; the 
13 
President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly 
14 
each shall recommend to the Governor a public member for 
15 
appointment within 20 days following the effective date of P.L.1985,

17

recommendation made in this manner shall become effective if the 
19 
Governor makes the appointment in accordance with the

thereof.  In each instance where the Governor fails to make the 
22 
appointment, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the 
23 
General Assembly shall make new recommendations subject to 
24 
appointment by the Governor as determined in this section.

27 
findings and recommendations of an administrative law judge after a

45 
meeting.  Action may be taken and motions and resolutions adopted

3 
and perform the duties of the trust. 
4 
 
e. 
Each director and the treasurer of the trust shall execute a 
5 
bond to be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of 
6

13 
expenses 
incurred 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
their 
duties.  
14 
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, no 
15 
officer or employee of the State shall be deemed to have forfeited or 
16 
shall forfeit the officer's or employee's office or employment or any 
17 
benefits or emoluments thereof by reason of the officer's or 
18 
employee's acceptance of the office of ex officio director of the trust 
19 
or the ex officio director's services thereon. 
20 
 
g. Each ex officio director may designate an officer of the ex 
21 
officio director's department to represent the ex officio director at 
22 
meetings of the trust.  Each designee may lawfully vote and otherwise 
23 
act on behalf of the director for whom the person constitutes the 
24 
designee.  The designation shall be delivered in writing to the trust 
25 
and shall continue in effect until revoked or amended in writing and

28 
debts or obligations outstanding or that provision has been made for 
29 
the payment or retirement of these debts or obligations.  The trust 
30 
shall continue in existence until dissolved by act of the Legislature.  
31

32 
trust shall be vested in the State.

minutes with a veto of any action taken by the trust or any member 
46

STATEMENT 
16 
 
17 
 
This bill would establish the Climate Change Mitigation and 
18 
Resilience Financing Program in the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank 
19 
(NJIB) and impose a per-kilowatt hour charge on electric public 
20 
utility customers to finance the program.   
21 
 
The purpose of the program would be to provide low interest loans 
22 
and other financial assistance, through the NJIB, for climate change 
23 
mitigation and resilience projects. Under the bill, “climate change 
24 
mitigation project” means a project whose primary purpose is the 
25 
construction, development, or production of energy sources, 
26 
infrastructure, land management techniques, or technologies that 
27 
eliminate, reduce, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions in the State.  
28 
Climate change mitigation projects would include Class I or Class II 
29 
renewable energy sources, community solar projects, energy 
30 
efficiency improvements, energy storage, zero-emission vehicle 
31 
infrastructure, zero-emission public transportation, carbon capture 
32 
and sequestration technologies, reforestation of degraded land, or 
33 
wetlands preservation and restoration.  “Climate change resilience 
34 
project” means an infrastructure project whose primary purpose is to 
35 
protect human health, safety, the environment, or public 
36 
infrastructure from the adverse effects of climate change including 
37 
drought, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and harmful algal 
38 
blooms.  Climate change resilience projects would include sea 
39 
barriers or other flood protection projects; water storage systems; the 
40 
removal, relocation, or redesign of public infrastructure; and projects 
41 
to mitigate harmful algal blooms.    
42 
 
The NJIB would be authorized to make both short-term and long-
43 
term loans to finance climate change mitigation and resilience 
44 
projects, and to issue bonds, notes, or other obligations to fund the 
45 
program.  Under the bill, the NJIB would be required to issue one or 
46 
more separate series of bonds to be known as “New Jersey Climate 
47 
Bonds.”  Proceeds from the bonds would be deposited into the State 
48

A1461 KARABINCHAK, KENNEDY 
44 
 
 
Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Bank Fund, established 
1 
under the bill, and used to finance climate change mitigation and 
2 
resilience projects and for other costs associated with the financing 
3 
program.  Issuance of New Jersey Climate Bonds would be subject 
4 
to existing laws concerning bonding, except that the trust would, to 
5 
the greatest extent practicable, be required to make the bonds 
6 
available for sale to individual investors, rather than institutional 
7 
investors, and in denominations suitable for such sales.    
8 
 
The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the 
9 
Board of Public Utilities (BPU) would be responsible for developing 
10 
a priority system, ranking criteria, and funding policies for climate 
11 
change mitigation and resilience projects financed under the bill.  The 
12 
DEP and the BPU would also be responsible for developing an annual 
13 
project priority list to be submitted for approval by the State 
14 
Legislature.  The DEP would prioritize projects that have the largest 
15 
impact on protecting human health, safety, the environment, and 
16 
critical infrastructure in the State from the adverse effects of climate 
17 
change; reducing the State’s greenhouse gas emissions; and meeting 
18 
the State’s clean energy goals.    
19 
 
The financing program would be funded by a non-bypassable, 
20 
irrevocable charge imposed on the customers of each electric public 
21 
utility in the State.  Beginning 120 days after the effective date of the 
22 
bill, the charge would be $0.0003 per kilowatt-hour sold to each 
23 
customer.  However, the charge would decrease over time as the State 
24 
meets certain renewable energy targets established in law.  The 
25 
charge would phase out completely upon certification by the BPU 
26 
that 100 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in the State are from Class 
27 
I and Class II renewable energy sources.
