The bill requires the Director of the Division of Purchase and 
3 
Property in the Department of the Treasury, the Director of the 
4 
Division of Property Management and Construction in the 
5 
Department of the Treasury, and all State and local agencies having

authority to contract for the purchase of goods or services to ensure 
7 
that all product specifications for new procurements advertised after 
8 
the bill is enacted into law reflect the guidelines developed, or 
9 
updated, if applicable and to the extent practical and feasible.  
10 
However, this requirement would not apply to a contract entered 
11 
into by a local contracting unit, if following the guidelines 
12 
developed, or updated, pursuant to the bill would increase the cost 
13 
of the contract.
