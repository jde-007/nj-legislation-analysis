SENATOR BOB SMITH (Chair):  Jim Kennedy is stuck in 
traffic, and, I can personally attest to it.  I was trying to be down here at 9:30 
today -- left at 8:30 -- it’s a 60-minute on-the-button kind of thing, and it 
took an hour and a half.  Route 1 had lots of problems today, for whatever 
reason. 
 
 
So, Assemblyman Kennedy said, “Get us started on time, and I’ll 
join you as soon as I get through the traffic.”  So, I don’t think we have to 
take roll -- it’s a hearing -- but, it would be great if we could introduce 
ourselves.  And, I don’t know all of the Assembly members. 
 
 
So, why don’t we start on the very end, and if you would 
introduce yourself and where you’re from, that would be great. 
 
 
MR. HARKNESS:  Sure. 
 
 
Dave Harkness with the Assembly Republican Office. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN 
SCHARFENBERGER: 
 
I’m 
Gerry 
Scharfenberger, Assemblyman from LD-13. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYWOMAN HAIDER:  Assemblywoman Shama 
Haider from LD-37. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN STERLEY S. STANLEY (Vice Chair):  
Assemblyman Sterley Stanley from the 18th District. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Yes, staff, too.  Let’s all get to know each 
other. 
 
 
MS. CALVO:  Carrie Anne Calvo, I am with the Office of 
Legislative Services. 
 
 
MR. ALOI:  Sam Aloi, Assembly Democratic Office. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Back here?

MS. THEODORE:  Elizabeth Theodore, also Assembly 
Democratic Office. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Great. 
 
 
MS. BERRIOS:  Melissa Berrios -- oh my God -- Office of 
Legislative Services. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  OK. 
 
 
Bob Smith, Senator. 
 
 
DR. GURRENTZ:  Joey Gurrentz, Senate Democrats Office. 
 
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  (indiscernible) Senate Democrats 
Office. 
 
 
MR. HANSEN:  I’m Eric Hansen, Office of Legislative Services. 
 
 
SENATOR STANFIELD:  I’m Jean Stanfield, 8th Legislative 
District Senator. 
 
 
MS. PANITCH:  I’m Rebecca Panitch with the Senate 
Republican Office. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Senator Durr, 3rd Legislative District. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Great. 
 
 
So, we’re here to listen. 
 
 
A little background for everybody:  More than a year ago, we 
asked many of the prominent leaders of our environmental community to 
help us.  And, the help is to gather information -- hopefully policies that the 
people of New Jersey could support -- with regard to our public forests in the 
State of New Jersey. 
 
 
And, every once in a while during the year, they would check in.  
Seems to me that more than 600 people participated in this process.  Over a 
 
 
 
3 
year, there were many, many, many meetings in an attempt to try to find 
consensus on policies and also identify items that don’t have consensus. 
 
 
So, we’re basically here to listen. 
 
 
And, I do want to publicly thank the four co-chairs who headed 
this Forestry Task Force, namely Andy Bennett from the New Jersey Forestry 
Association; Tom Gilbert from the New Jersey Conservation Foundation; 
Eileen Murphy from New Jersey Audubon; and, Anjuli Ramos, Sierra Club. 
 
 
They put in countless hours, and I know that you all have 
families and other real lives to participate in, so it was wonderful that you 
could devote all the time that you devoted into putting together the task force 
findings and recommendations. 
 
 
And, I had a chance to begin reading this 270-page document 
last night.  I got about an hour into it, and I was really impressed by how 
inclusive the document was.  If you get a chance to read it, you really want 
to read it, because every -- as far as I can tell, everybody’s point of view was 
in there.  You actually could say, “Let’s not have a hearing today because we 
already know what everybody is going to say,” and, that’s not really true. 
 
 
We really need to educate the Legislature, which is really why 
we’re here, and, hopefully at the end of -- we’re going to continue to get input 
for the record.  And, I mean for the record; there’s a court stenographer 
recording everything everybody says.  So, no bad words today, all right? 
 
 
But, Number 2, the record is being kept open for another three 
weeks.  So, if you want to put in additional information for all of us to 
consider, we’ll happily do that.  And, I’m hoping sometime months from now 
-- sooner, if possible -- we’re going to put together forestry legislation that 
 
 
 
4 
hopefully will set policy for our public forests and hopefully do other good 
things to help the forests, because they do need a lot of help. 
 
 
So, with that being said, New Jersey Forestry Task Force is at bat 
first.  What did you find out? What were consensus items? What were not 
consensus items? And, especially, tell us about the process. 
 
 
I mean, I want people in this room to know how much you 
suffered, all right.  So, the legislators can say, “This sounds -- it’s maybe the 
real deal.” 
 
 
Who is going to be the first?  Eileen? 
 
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  We’re going to introduce 
ourselves and-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Tell me how you wanted to do it. 
 
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  We’re going to introduce 
ourselves and our organizations, and then I’ll start with the process. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Go ahead; go to it. 
A N D Y   B E N N E T T:  Well, good morning. 
 
 
My name is Andy Bennett.  I am a Director of the New Jersey 
Forestry Association.  For nearly 50 years, the Forestry Association has 
promoted responsible and sustainable forest stewardship on both private and 
public lands.  The Association is dedicated to the wise use, conservation, and 
scientific management of New Jersey’s forest resources, both now and for 
future generations. 
 
 
In my day job, I am a consulting forester, serving more than 750 
landowners in northern New Jersey who collectively own more than 35,000 
acres.  I also have the great honor of assisting my family in stewarding our 
450-acre farm in Sussex County, which includes about 400 forested acres. 
 
 
 
5 
 
 
And, lastly, I do all this with lots of help, including my wife and 
my four kids.  As foresters, we’re trained to think 20, 40, 60, 100 years down 
the road – which, at times, can be challenging, but I have found that I’m 
thankful for my kids, because parenting -- we’re investing in the future, and 
I think managing our forest resources is very similar. The decisions we make 
today are going to have an effect 50 years, 100 years down the road.  That’s 
what we’re here to talk about. 
 
 
So, Chairman Smith, thank you for inviting the Forestry 
Association to be part of this, to be on the Task Force -- but, not only that, 
to be a Chairman on the Task Force.  So, I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and I 
would just qualify it with “for the most part.”  Like you said, it wasn’t always 
amazing, but it was a lot of fun. I learned a lot, and I just want to commend 
these three -- these folks were awesome.  I was usually -- when the four of us 
met, make no mistake, I was the idiot in the room.  These guys are awesome. 
They’re smart; they’re intelligent; and I’m grateful for having done this with 
them. 
 
 
So, thank you. 
T O M   G I L B E R T:  Good morning. 
 
 
Hi, my name is Tom Gilbert, and I’m Co-Executive Director of 
New Jersey Conservation Foundation. 
 
 
And, we work to preserve land and nature for the benefit of all 
New Jerseyans -- rural, urban, and suburban -- because it is critical to our 
health and our quality of life for present and future generations. 
 
 
We’ve preserved over 140,000 acres of open space and farmland 
throughout the state since 1960, and we support sensible policies to protect 
natural resources and address the climate crisis. 
 
 
 
6 
 
 
I also want to note that we own and manage 17 preserves around 
the state, many of them which are forested -- that total over 27,000 acres of 
land.  And, that includes over 11,000 acres at our Franklin Parker Preserve, 
which is in the heart of the Pine Barrens, where we work with the DEP and 
we do prescribed burning to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire and also 
to sustain the Pine Barrens ecosystem. 
 
 
Senator, I just want to thank you for your leadership in calling 
us together to focus on these important issues. 
 
 
I also want to thank and commend my fellow Co-Chairs; I could 
not say enough good things about, kind of, how we all dug in together and 
worked hard to find common ground. 
 
 
I want to thank all of the participants of the Task Force -- the 
many participants, many hours.  And, everyone really had the same goal in 
mind.  We didn’t always agree on every detail, but everyone was really 
committed to finding a better future for our public forest land. 
 
 
So, thank you. 
A N J U L I   R A M O S - B U S O T:  Good morning, everybody. 
 
 
My name is Anjuli Ramos, and I am the New Jersey Chapter 
Director for the Sierra Club. 
 
 
The Sierra Club is the most enduring and influential grassroots 
environmental organization in the United States.  The New Jersey Chapter -
- 80,000-plus members and supporters -- are a powerful force working to 
defend our right to a livable environment. 
 
 
A little bit of our mission:  To explore, enjoy, and protect the 
wild places of the Earth; to practice and promote the responsible use of the 
Earth’s ecosystems and resources; and, to educate and enlist humanity to 
 
 
 
7 
protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environments.  For 
over 125 years, Sierra Club members have worked to protect the Earth’s vital 
resources, natural beauty, wild creatures, and scenic landscapes. 
 
 
I just want to thank Senator Smith for your leadership for 
creating this Task Force.  It’s a lot of work, but we are very thankful for that, 
because we think that we’re moving forward. 
 
 
And, I also want to thank my fellow Co-Chairs.  I want to echo 
what Andy said, except for that we were the only smart ones -- he is also very 
smart. 
 
 
And, I want to echo Tom’s comments.  This process was very 
long.  A lot--  A big commitment that we are very grateful to everybody who 
participated, because it definitely developed the conversation we have, really, 
the framework.  And, we learned a lot in the process. 
 
 
And, thank you everybody for being here and for listening to us. 
E I L E E N   M U R P H Y, Ph.D.:  Thank you. 
 
 
And, finally, I am Eileen Murphy.  I am Vice President of 
Government Relations at New Jersey Audubon.  I’ve been here for about 
three years.  I have a Ph.D. in Environmental Science, but it’s not in forestry.  
I work on contaminants in drinking water and spent 21 years at New Jersey 
DEP doing drinking water research -- for a little bit about me. 
 
 
New Jersey Audubon is privately supported.  We’re the oldest 
independent Audubon in the country with over 25,000 members.  We were 
established in 1897.  We have an education department; a research 
department; government relations; and a stewardship department, all doing 
on-the-ground work to connect people to nature.  We maintain stewardship 
of 34 sanctuaries and we conduct our education program at seven staffed 
 
 
 
8 
facilities.  We’re committed to the preservation of natural habitats and the 
protection of birds, mammals, and other animals and plants -- especially 
threatened and endangered species. 
 
 
And, the four of us, when we initiated this endeavor, we didn’t 
know each other well.  We knew each other by reputation, and we were aware 
of our organizations’ contentious relationships on this particular issue.  But, 
over the course of the past year, we as four Co-Chairs have come together in 
agreement -- not 100% on every issue -- but enough to work together to 
forward some good forest policies for the State of New Jersey. 
 
 
So, I thank everyone, and ditto on everything that they said. 
 
 
So, with that, I am -- I’m starting out, all four of us have different 
areas that we’re going to present to you today.  And, I’m going to focus on 
the process.  And, I know that process can be boring, but it’s very important 
to understand we are four nonprofit groups with zero capacity to run a 
stakeholder process of this magnitude the way that we might like to do it; the 
way that a government entity might do it.  But, we did investigate Sunshine 
Laws; we investigated how government handles stakeholder groups, and tried 
to mimic it as best we could. 
 
 
So, I am going to go into the process.  You’ll notice in some of 
the dissenting opinions there were some complaints about the process, so I 
think it’s important to lay the baseline so that you’re aware of what our 
intentions were; of where we pivoted when we thought we needed to pivot; 
and, where we landed. 
 
 
So, just about a year ago, Senator Smith announced the creation 
of the Task Force.  There had been four bills that were introduced in the 
legislature, and they were very controversial; there was a lot of opposition.  
 
 
 
9 
And, we think that this prompted this Task Force.  Senator Smith and others 
wanted to know, “How pervasive is this opposition?  What do you want, 
green community?  What is it that we can do to keep our forests healthy?” 
 
 
So, he brought us -- we four together, our four organizations who 
had varying, divergent opinions about this -- together to work with anyone 
else in the state with an interest to discover:  Are there issues that we can 
agree on?  And, if so, what are they?  Specifically, his charge to us was to 
study and identify ways in which the State can best manage its forests in 
order to fight climate change; prevent forest fires; improve ecosystems; and 
protect soil and water quality among other things.  And, that was our charge, 
and we stuck to it throughout the year that we worked together. 
 
 
Early on, we created a Google account.  We knew that there was 
tremendous interest in the state in this issue, and we wanted to be able to 
share materials.  We wanted a neutral place not involved with any of our 
organizations where people could go to share information; where we could 
send emails and receive emails in a neutral way.  So, we created a Google 
account.  It had a YouTube channel, we recorded all of our meetings, we 
loaded them up on the YouTube channel, and we started to create 
distribution lists. 
 
 
Senator Smith, you had asked some other groups throughout the 
state for their email lists.  I believe the Highlands Coalition had had a forestry 
symposium with 600 people registered.  We contacted all of those 600 -- they 
graciously shared that email list with us.  New Jersey Audubon has a forestry 
webinar series, and we had an email list of about 200 that we actively 
engaged.  And, then, other professional associations and other academics, 
etc., where we went out to them and invited their participation. 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
In addition, again, anyone with an interest -- not necessarily an 
expertise, but an interest in forests in New Jersey -- was invited to write to 
the Forest Task Force email and say, “I want to be included in the distribution 
list.”  Whether they wanted to be active participants or passive participants 
didn’t matter; if they were interested and sent us an email, they were included 
on the list. 
 
 
So, by April -- this all started in February -- we had 1,200 email 
addresses on our distribution list.  This is a lot, and it was a wide variety of 
people throughout the state who were professional practitioners; academics; 
conservation groups; advocacy groups; and many members of the general 
public -- residents who had an interest in healthy forests in New Jersey.  So, 
given this number, we thought, “How are we going to establish what the most 
important issues to 1,200 people are?” 
 
 
So, we did have a general idea of what the important priorities 
are in this state, and we developed a survey.  In this survey, we listed 11 
different potential forestry policies like deer control, invasive species, 
biodiversity, climate-change impacts, and sent that survey out to the list of 
1,200 people.  Four hundred and thirteen responded to that survey, and we 
took a look at it, and said, “OK, what are the results telling us?”  There were 
11 priorities.  Are we going to have 11 work groups to look at all of these 
different priorities, or something else?  Well, what it turned out is that the 
results seemed to center around two main issues:  climate change and 
ecological health.  So, we created two working groups: a climate working 
group and an ecological health working group and proceeded from there.  
 
 
Throughout the rest of the discussions, that survey that 
established priorities for the state informed how we moved forward.  Initially 
 
 
 
11 
-- and, maybe naively -- we sought a consensus approach.  We wanted to find 
where 95%, 80% of the participants could land on certain issues.  We learned 
early on that that was a very high bar, given the group that was this large and 
this diverse.  Ultimately, we pivoted to looking at broad agreement rather 
than formal consensus -- again, given the size of the participants and their 
diversity of opinions. 
 
 
I will say, though, there is one area where there is 100% 
consensus, and that is every single participant cares about New Jersey’s 
forests.  They do.  Where we diverge is how to get there.  So, I did want to 
point that out; we have that 100% consensus issue.  Yay. 
 
 
(laughter) 
 
 
We also wanted -- we wanted to empower the participants as 
much as possible, so we determined we were going to have a proposal-
solicitation process, whereby we are asking the participants to send proposals 
to us and gave them a set of criteria for what would be a good proposal for 
discussion by the larger group.  And, that is, provide a proposal where there 
is one clear recommendation that can later be transferred into legislative 
action.  So, one idea at a time.  We didn’t want five ideas in one proposal; 
we were really looking to break this apart so that we could have discussions.  
So, we created almost like an RFP -- a call for proposals -- with some guidance 
and described that process. 
 
 
So, with our ideas of having consensus and with this proposal 
and the two work groups, we scheduled our first meeting -- our kickoff 
meeting on April 28.  Four hundred people registered for that initial meeting, 
and 338 attended.  That’s 338 little squares on Zoom.  So, you know, we 
 
 
 
12 
wanted to make sure that all of those squares had an opportunity to speak if 
they wanted to. 
 
 
So, the way we set it up:  We invited anyone who wanted to 
speak to let us know if they wanted to speak at that meeting; 125 people did, 
so we -- that’s a lot of people to speak at a public meeting -- so we gave them 
two-minute limits.  We set it up so that if you want to speak, you can, but 
it’ll be two minutes just for time constraints.  And, if you didn’t sign up to 
speak but later you determined you want to, you had an opportunity then, 
too.  After all the people who registered, then we started calling on other folks 
using the “raise hand” feature of Zoom.  We established some rules for 
engagement for Zoom.  I don’t know if many of you are aware of Zoom -- 
there can be interruptions, there can -- you really need to establish some 
housekeeping rules, which we did.  We established rules of engagement 
which, for the most part, the participants abided by.  Again, people wanted 
this to work.  People were interested.  There were high passions, and also high 
interest. 
 
 
We established our -- we described the consensus approach at 
that initial meeting, again, thinking that that’s the way we were going to go, 
and then we invited comment.  After the initial meeting, we scheduled two 
meetings every other week:  One for the climate group, and one for the 
ecological health group, and some of the people attended both.  For others, 
they attended one or the other.  And, we had that schedule all the way 
through December.  So, it’s over 30 meetings of two hours each, minimum -- 
many meetings went over that -- and, in between these larger Task Force 
meetings, the four of us would meet once or twice in between to go over what 
 
 
 
13 
we heard; to go over the emails that people had sent us; and to discuss and 
hash out the issues that we heard. 
 
 
Those early meetings -- we fought, the four of us.  Sorry Tom -- 
I remember yelling at Tom-- 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  (laughter) 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  --and apologizing later. 
 
 
These were not easy meetings for the four of us, or for the larger 
Task Force.  We all had closely held opinions about forest management, and 
we each wanted to convince the other that we were right.  And, in fact, what 
we needed to do was come together. 
 
 
We had described the proposal submission.  We had two rounds 
of proposals.  One hundred thirty-two proposals were submitted overall, and 
they kind of were categorized kind of similarly to our initial survey -- which 
isn’t surprising:  Deer management; planning; inventory; biodiversity; climate 
change; proforestation.  These are all some of the common topics that we saw 
in the proposals that were submitted.  So, what we did initially, again, was to 
invite proposal sponsors -- that is the people who submitted the proposals -- 
to come and present their idea to the larger group.  Again, we were trying to 
empower the participants so that it wasn’t always just the four of us bringing 
them ideas, it was the participants bringing ideas to the larger group. 
 
 
We selected -- we had criteria for the proposals that we accepted 
for discussion, and then invited at first what we considered to be non-
controversial proposals.  We thought, “Let’s stick with some easy ones and 
see how it goes.”  And, I’m glad we did that.  (laughter) 
 
 
Also, throughout the meetings, when necessary or when 
appropriate, we did invite New Jersey Department of Environmental 
 
 
 
14 
Protection representatives, for instance, to describe the current invasive 
species program; to describe their current mechanisms for deer control; to 
describe the current conditions of New Jersey public forests.  We felt it was 
important for all of the members of the Task Force to have the same 
information from the entity that’s actually responsible for regulating and 
implementing forest-management activities in the state. 
 
 
The general meeting format of all of these meetings from April 
through December, the four of us co-facilitated discussions.  Tom and I 
facilitated ecological health -- although we also attended the climate meetings 
-- and Andy and Anjuli facilitated the climate meetings, and they attended 
our meetings.  We always went over the rules of engagement, particularly in 
those early meetings.  We took advantage of technology using Zoom -- chat 
and Q&A features were available for all the participants to communicate with 
us, with the Co-Chairs.  On occasion we used polling; sometimes there’d be 
some heated discussion on a particular topic, but, oftentimes, there was 
always at least 100 people at any given meeting.  And, we would hear from 
20 at a particular meeting, which would mean there were 80 people not 
speaking.  So, in order to ascertain, “What are those other 80 people 
thinking?”  we would occasionally use the polling feature in Zoom. 
 
 
The attendees did decrease over time; that’s not unexpected.  
Again, we had 338 at the kickoff meeting, and then we averaged in the 
hundreds for subsequent meetings.  But, representation--  Again, anyone with 
an interest could participate and participate in the polling and in the surveys. 
 
 
For organizations, though, we asked them to select a 
representative.  So, one formal representative for their organization.  Which 
isn’t to say that if you had other board members from that organization they 
 
 
 
15 
could speak -- of course they could participate; they could do the polls.  But, 
in our formal surveys -- we asked that those organizations -- only their 
representative to participate in the formals.  Because we didn’t want double 
counting.  If you’re a member of an organization -- a simple member of an 
organization -- that didn’t count.  So, for instance, at New Jersey Audubon 
there was a board member who was participating who was not our authorized 
representative.  That board member could not participate in formal polling, 
but she could certainly speak at meetings and could participate in the 
informal polling.  And, of course, individual residents could do all of the 
above. 
 
 
The organizations really ranged from very small groups; 
environmental commissions; shade tree commissions; to regional groups, like 
the Pinelands Commission; to statewide groups like New Jersey Audubon, 
New Jersey Conservation Foundation; and, then, some national groups 
participated as well.  So, we had high variation in the organization types and 
sizes throughout. 
 
 
All right, so, at our first few meetings where we invited proposal 
sponsors to come and present some of their ideas, we noticed that, even 
though some of the topics seemed, in this discussion, to enjoy broad 
agreement, we couldn’t get past certain issues.  And, we spent some time the 
first four or so meetings trying to focus on the proposals that we had 
presented to the group.  And, we learned that there were two issues that kept 
getting brought up, and it was an impasse -- we couldn’t discuss any topic 
until we resolved these two topics:  Proforestation and logging.  So, I’m going 
to define proforestation and how we address that, and then I’ll define logging 
and how we address that.  In order to move us forward, we couldn’t -- we just 
 
 
 
16 
couldn’t talk about anything else in the beginning, so we felt, “Let’s tackle 
this head on so that we can talk about other things.” 
 
 
So, proforestation is defined in the New Jersey DEP Forest 
Action Plan, and elsewhere, “The practice of growing a forest and keeping it 
intact in order to maximize its ecological potential.”  So, to address this, there 
was a paper -- this proforestation term was coined by Professor Moomaw and 
some of his colleagues in a paper, perspective paper, in -- What was it in? -- 
Frontiers for Global Change under the journal section of “Tropical Forests.”  
This appeared in 2019.  So, we invited Professor Moomaw and another 
author on his paper, Ed Faison, to do a panel presentation here for us in New 
Jersey.  We also invited one of the forest ecologists that they cited in their 
paper frequently, Keeton -- Bill Keeton -- to be a panel member; and, then, a 
fourth person, Tony D’Amato, who is a leading expert on silviculture and 
climate change in proforestation.  So, we have four panel members not from 
New Jersey to come to speak to us about the general issue of proforestation.  
And, then, we followed that with Q&A from all of the participants who 
wanted to attend.   So, 125 people attended that particular webinar.  We 
recorded it, put it on the YouTube channel, and shared that.   
 
 
To address logging -- first, to define it.  “Logging, or harvest, is 
the removal of trees for wood fiber use and other multiple-use purposes.”  
And, this came up quite a few times, too.  To address this, we did a survey, 
and in the results section that’s going to be presented later, you’ll see the 
results of that survey.  We just wanted to know, of the group of common 
participants, of those 100 people who have been attending all of the meetings, 
what are your thoughts about this?  And, that will help inform the direction 
that we take our future meetings. 
 
 
 
17 
 
 
We also -- in addition to that survey -- we dedicated two full, 
two-hour meetings -- I believe both of them went over two hours -- to this 
discussion of logging, with the caveat that we would move forward on the 
other topics that were introduced to us through the proposal after that.  
Again, this is the opportunity to talk about logging, and then we don’t want 
to talk about it anymore.  Let’s talk about it, we’re going to give it its due, 
but there’s so many other issues we need to address.  That was -- that’s how 
we presented it to the group. 
 
 
Both topics, however, continued to be raised at every meeting, 
preventing discussion on other issues like reforestation, urban forestry, and 
other ideas that we thought might be priorities, and for which proposals were 
submitted.  They did continue to be raised all the way into December, and, 
that was their right. If a person raised their hand in Zoom and wanted to 
make a comment about that, of course we allowed it, because this was a 
participatory process.  However, by the summer, we realized we were not 
going to move forward either with consensus or with our proposal ideas, so 
we pivoted. 
 
 
By now, we had information from the survey and from the 
proposals that were submitted.  We had a general idea of what topics seemed 
to be important to the participants:  things like deer control; invasive species.  
So, we pivoted away from consensus more toward broad agreement and away 
from the proposal and into a framework, a conceptual framework.  We 
developed a conceptual framework, our very first draft, and sent it out to the 
group in a survey fashion.  We went over it in a meeting, in both the climate 
meeting and ecological health, and invited clarifying questions and comments 
and then invited comment on each individual point within the framework 
 
 
 
18 
and on the framework as a whole.  We did this three times; each time we 
received really thoughtful comments on all of the issues in the framework.  A 
lot were contradictory from each other.  I want to make that point because I 
think when you give a comment and you feel it wasn’t addressed or you think 
we ignored it -- no, it kind of means that there was another comment in direct 
contradiction, and we had to kind of reconcile those two.  We did this three 
times, and then we had a final format which appears in your report. 
 
 
We were feeling pretty good, actually, at the end of this.  The 
framework was generating some really good and thoughtful discussion, and 
four main areas were really making themselves present and we decided to 
focus our final meetings on those four areas.  They were:  fire, invasive species, 
natural areas and reserves, and deer management.  We invited proposal 
sponsors to come and speak about those issues in particular, and those wound 
up being our favorite meetings of the entire Task Force.  They generated so 
much great discussion, and a lot of agreement. 
 
 
So we started with proposals, we pivoted to the framework, and 
then back to proposals.  At the end, we did a final survey based on the 
framework.  We had converted them from statements into recommendations 
because, after all, we are making recommendations.  And, we sent a final 
survey.  For this particular one, we asked for support or not support of the 
whole framework as a holistic piece, rather than individual recommendations, 
and that is what you are going to hear in the results. 
 
 
And, unless any of the Co-Chairs have anything to add about the 
process, I’m going to move it to Anjuli, who will talk about the results. 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  All right, thank you, Eileen. 
 
 
 
19 
 
 
So, as Eileen just mentioned, all of the numerous meetings, 
surveys, and feedback ultimately informed this framework that she just 
discussed. 
 
 
And, also, mentioned by Eileen, the topic of cutting and 
removing trees -- reaching consensus and moving forward with our discussion 
was very difficult.  So, therefore, in that effort to hear all views, two two-hour 
meetings -- as mentioned by Eileen -- were held to discuss issues surrounding 
tree cutting and removal of wood products.  The sponsors of the proposals 
related to these issues were invited to discuss their proposals, and discussion 
was open to all interested participants.  After hours of discussion, it seemed 
clear to the Co-Chairs that consensus among participants on the Zoom call 
would not be reached on these issues, no matter how many additional hours 
might be spent discussing them. 
 
 
It was unclear what the majority view was, therefore, a survey 
using Google Forms was created and sent to all Task Force participants to 
understand the participants’ positions on these issues.  The results can be 
found on page 15 and 16 of the report that you all have, but, to make things 
easier, we are showing them here visually. 
 
 
So, the first pie chart here that you can see is the results for 
cutting trees.  So, essentially, we asked all participants, “Is this something 
that you never -- you don’t want to see it ever happening,” so never permitted, 
or, “Happening only for ecological health objectives for that particular 
forest,” “For any reason,” or, “Abstain,” because we had a little bit of that.  
So, overall, the tree-cutting survey results show that a majority of respondents 
-- which is 83%, which is the addition of yellow and red -- supported allowing 
the cutting of trees to meet ecological objectives or other reasons.  The largest 
 
 
 
20 
contingent, 66% -- which is in red -- supported cutting trees for only 
ecological health purposes, while a minority of participants -- 14%, in the 
blue -- indicated that trees should never be cut for any reason.  Lastly, 17% 
in yellow responded that trees can be cut for any reason, including the 
generation of revenue. 
 
 
The second question that we asked is with products.  So, what 
does that mean?  That means that if and when you need to cut a tree, are you 
OK with removing that tree from the forest, from the soil?  So, overall, the 
wood-removal survey results showed that a majority of respondents -- 62%, 
which is the addition of the red and the yellow colors. 
 
 
And, I want to clarify -- we think the 41% should be 42%.  Sorry, 
that was typo.  But, it is correct in your report. 
 
 
So, supported -- so, this majority supported allowing the removal 
of wood to meet ecological goals or for other reasons.  The largest contingent 
in the red color, which is the 42%, supported the removal of wood only for 
ecological health purposes, while 36% in the blue color of participants 
indicated that wood should never be removed for any reason.  And, 20% in 
the yellow responded that wood could be removed for any reason, including 
revenue generation. 
 
 
So, I want to emphasize again that these surveys heavily 
informed how we were moving forward with the framework.  This is the 
opinion of all of the Task Force members that were actively participating in 
all of these meetings. 
 
 
So, as previously mentioned by Eileen, for the draft frameworks, 
the co-chairs asked participants to provide input on each individual 
recommendation.  However, the final version, the co-chairs asked 
 
 
 
21 
participants if they could support the framework as one comprehensive 
recommendation rather than 16 separate parts.  The rationale for this was to 
develop a holistic approach to sorting New Jersey’s public forests rather than 
16 specific recommendations found in the framework.  This approach also 
acknowledged the idea that, along the way, the draft frameworks were being 
discussed and refined; compromises were being made on specific 
recommendations in order to move towards broad agreement on the full 
package of recommendations.  The four co-chairs worked to be responsive 
and to reconcile different perspectives in order to build broad support for the 
recommendations.  Our hope was that even if participants did not agree with 
every single recommendation, that they would support the holistic package 
because their priorities were concluded, one way or another. 
 
 
However, we also understood that some participants would not 
support the entire framework, even if one recommendation was not exactly 
the way they wanted.  The survey templates utilized to collect input of the 
three versions of the framework appear in appendix B of your report.  By the 
end of the Task Force discussion, the four co-chairs reached consensus 
amongst the four of us on the entire framework informed by the active 
conversations at the Task Force meetings; all the participants’ feedback 
regarding the individual frameworks’ recommendations; and all surveys 
conducted. 
 
 
The super majority -- which means two-thirds -- of participants 
supported the final framework recommendations.  In total, 113 responses 
were recorded from organization representatives and individuals.  There were 
49 organizations with formal authorized representatives -- as Eileen described 
-- every organization had one representative.  Yes, and 64 individual New 
 
 
 
22 
Jersey residents responded to the survey.  Responses from organizations and 
individuals resulted in the same level of support:  67% supported the 
framework, while 33% did not. 
 
 
And, the following visual is the display of organizations and 
individuals.  And, as you can all see, it’s the same results as I just mentioned 
for both -- 33% of organizations did not support, as well as for individuals, 
and 67% of individuals and organizations supported the framework.  And, 
below that, you have the total in numbers, not percentages. 
 
 
Bear with me, too many pages. 
 
 
Yes -- so, in the interest of time, I am only going to list the 
organizations that supported and not supported, not the individuals -- it’s a 
total of 64 individuals.  So, I am going to start with the organizations that 
did not support the framework.  These are a total of 16 organizations:  Animal 
Protection League of New Jersey; Empower NJ; Environmental Education 
Fund; Friends of Drew Forest; Great Swamp Watershed Association; The 
Highlands Coalition; League of Humane Voters; New Jersey Environmental 
Lobby; NJ Forest Watch; New York-New Jersey Trail Conference; Passaic 
River Coalition; Rich (indiscernible) Conservancy; Sourland Conservancy; 
Support Roaring Rock Park; Thonet Associates; Woods & Wayside. 
 
 
The organizations that supported the framework -- 33 of them:  
Allegheny Society of American Forests New Jersey Division; Appalachian 
Mountain Club; Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions; 
Beaver Lake Realty Company; Duke Farms; Friends of Hopewell Valley Open 
Space; Great Egg Harbor Watershed Association; Hackensack Riverkeeper; 
Lebanon Township Environmental & Open Space Commission; Monmouth 
County Audubon; Morris County Park Commission; National Wild Turkey 
 
 
 
23 
Federation -- New Jersey Chapter; New Jersey Nursery and Landscape 
Association; New Jersey Outdoor Alliance PAC; New Jersey State Federation 
of Sportsmen’s Clubs; New Jersey Tree Farm; Ocean County Department of 
Parks 
and 
Recreation; 
Pinelands 
Preservation 
Alliance; 
Princeton 
Environmental Commission; Princeton Shade Tree Commission; Raritan 
Headwaters Association -- almost there; Raritan Township Environmental 
Commission; Somerset County Parks; The Nature Conservancy; The 
Wildlife Society -- New Jersey Chapter; Tri-County Sustainability; Union 
County Parks; USDA NRCS -- New Jersey State Office; UU FaithAction NJ; 
and, of course, the support of our four organizations:  New Jersey Audubon; 
New Jersey Conservation Foundation; New Jersey Forestry Association; and 
the New Jersey Sierra Club. 
 
 
So, with that, those were the results for both the key survey that 
we conducted regarding the issue of logging, and the results for the overall 
framework that we present as a holistic package for the Legislature to move 
forward. 
 
 
I just want to add one note.  When we go into discussing the 
framework, you will see that all recommendations kind of depend on each 
other, and it makes sense to propose this as a full package. 
 
 
And, with that, I’ll leave it to Andy. 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  OK, thank you Anjuli -- and Eileen. 
 
 
So, Tom and I are going to just briefly summarize kind of the 
high points of both the supporting and dissenting opinions. 
 
 
So, I’m referencing page 11 if you’re looking at your book there.  
So, page 11 at the top talks about the main topics in the supporting opinions.  
 
 
 
24 
So, we just kind of sifted through and pulled out a couple that seemed to be 
kind of recurring themes of those who were in support of the framework. 
 
 
The first one was the most common topic from participants who 
submitted supporting opinions, concerned ensuring adequate funding for 
resources and staff to New Jersey DEP to carry out the recommendations in 
the framework.  So, funding. 
 
 
And, Number 2, overall supporting commenters thought the 
process used by the co-chairs was robust and fair, and, given the large number 
of participants, the optimal way to identify and categorize consensus and 
non-consensus participant opinions about forest protections and forest 
management in the state. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  OK, thanks, Andy. 
 
 
So, I’m going to summarize some of the main dissenting opinions 
that were registered. 
 
 
The first was the issue of logging, which Eileen described, and 
Anjuli in the survey as well.  And, concerns raised by some participants about 
any removal or sale of wood products and concern that that was occurring on 
state land, should not be. 
 
 
Second, we also heard numerous concerns about one particular 
forest-management plan, the Sparta Mountain Forest Management Plan, 
which is a State wildlife management area in the northwestern part of the 
state, was mentioned repeatedly as an example of the logging concerns that 
we noted. 
 
 
Third, the issue of climate change.  So, we did hear from some 
participants who felt that climate change, specifically carbon sequestration 
and storage, should be the primary focus, the primary goal for management 
 
 
 
25 
of our public forest lands.  There were some who felt it should be really the 
sole consideration; a little bit of both; and that other considerations, such as 
biodiversity, wildlife protections, water quality, climate resiliency, and other 
ecological goals should be subordinate to a focus on climate change. 
 
 
Some participants called for a moratorium on any new or existing 
forest-management plans on state lands, and they urged that a moratorium 
be put in place indefinitely, or until the Task Force report was finished. 
 
 
As Eileen noted, there also were concerns raised about the 
process itself that we undertook.  Some participants felt like we should have 
spent more time discussing and debating science -- the science behind forest 
ecology, forest (indiscernible), forest management.  Some felt that we should 
have been actually taking votes on specific elements -- something we 
considered but, ultimately, dispensed with because frankly it’s just too 
complicated to figure out how to do it in a way that people (indiscernible). 
 
 
And, also, the issue of proforestation.  Some felt they wanted the 
term proforestation to be used specifically in the final recommendations. 
 
 
So, those were the main things that we heard.  I’m sure that we’ll 
hear some additional issues from the second panel.  We would just note, also, 
that many who dissented did not -- they supported some aspects of the 
framework, but there were other aspects of the framework that they had 
issues with.  So, in some cases, there wasn’t -- it was sort of a mixed bag in 
terms of their feeling on the several recommendations. 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  OK, moving right along here. 
 
 
Once again, I’m going to just reference a page; this is page two.  
I would like to read the co-chair statement. 
 
 
 
26 
 
 
And, I just want to emphasize, this is--  You’ve heard this from 
each of us already, but we are obviously four very different people from four 
very different organizations with differing ideas of how to do all this; different 
backgrounds; different experiences; etc.  But, we worked very hard to stick 
together, the four of us, and I think this statement -- we each worked on this 
statement together and apart.  So, this represents the four of us very well. 
 
 
So, like the Task Force participants, the co-chairs came into this 
process with very different backgrounds and perspectives on these issues.  
However, through many hours of discussion with the participants, agency, 
and academic experts and each other, we reached agreement on a 
comprehensive high-level framework to guide the protection and 
management of New Jersey’s public forest lands.  Finding common ground 
was not easy given the passionate and divergent views on these issues.  But, 
through healthy give and take, we crafted a framework that enjoyed support 
from two-thirds of the many organizations and individuals involved. 
 
 
We are united in our belief that these recommendations, if 
adequately funded and implemented effectively through legislation and 
rulemaking, will result in significant steps being taken towards better 
protecting and stewarding our public forest lands.  These recommendations 
acknowledge the vital role the forest must play as part of the State’s response 
to the climate crisis, while also recognizing the equally important goals of 
ecological health, biological diversity, clean air and water, and recreation 
opportunities in the most densely populated state in the nation. 
 
 
And, lastly, these recommendations acknowledge the deep, 
intrinsic value of our forests apart from human use. 
 
 
 
27 
 
 
We’re going to shift now to what I would kind of call -- to us, it’s 
kind of like the crown jewel of our report, is the framework you’ve been 
hearing about.  And, the framework is made up of -- we’re going to walk 
through these 16 different recommendations, OK. 
 
 
But, before we get into this, I would like to make an appeal to 
everyone.  And, Anjuli mentioned this; I think Eileen did, too.  But, it would 
be easy to view these 16 recommendations almost as if they’re items on a 
menu that you get to choose from.  I like Number 1, I like Number 6, I like 
Number 13, but I don’t like Number 4 -- I would refrain from doing that, 
because what I’d like you to understand is that’s not how this was put 
together.  This was put together as a cohesive kind of package.  And, I would 
equate it to the game of Jenga.  We like to play Jenga in our house with our 
kids, but all the blocks kind of work together to build this tower, right?  When 
you start to pull a block out, that’s when the thing gets unstable. 
 
 
So, these recommendations really lean into each other; they 
build off of one another, and they’re meant to be looked at as a package, as 
one unit.  So, I just wanted to make that clear, that -- don’t look at it as a 
menu; it’s one package, that’s how we’re going to be discussing it today, OK? 
 
 
Thank you. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Thanks, Andy. 
 
 
So, we’re going to move into the recommendations now. 
 
 
Just, a little bit of context first.  So, again, our charge was to focus 
on New Jersey’s public forest lands, not the entirety of New Jersey’s forest 
lands.  And, just for context, according to the most recent State Forest Action 
Plan, New Jersey has just shy of 2 million acres of forest land, which is 40% 
of the state’s land area.  Forty-eight percent of those forests are privately 
 
 
 
28 
owned, and that was not the focus of our deliberations.  Of those remaining 
forests, 31% are owned by the State, 14% by the counties -- by counties or 
municipalities -- and 7% by the Federal government.  There’s a certain 
amount in there that’s also held by private land concerns, such as ours, as 
well. 
 
 
So, just wanted to put that out there to set the stage and remind 
everyone that what we’re talking about are recommendations for our public 
forest lands only. 
 
 
So, the first recommendation is that the New Jersey DEP should 
be directed to initiate and conduct a statewide planning and mapping process 
for our forested public lands in New Jersey.  And, that process should be 
based upon the best available science and data.  And, in some cases, that 
would require some additional inventories of significant biota, as needed and 
feasible.  The planning process should be directed by a scientific advisory 
panel, and it should require public participation throughout the process.  We 
recommend that it focus first on State-owned lands, and then be extended to 
significant forested parcels of county, municipal, and other lands acquired 
using State funding. 
 
 
Secondly -- and this can almost be a recommendation in and of 
itself -- we recommend that the planning process identify places of historical, 
cultural, and spiritual significance for indigenous people.  And, we did have 
participation from Chief Mann, who is Turtle Clan Chief of the Ramapough 
Lenape Nation, and they did educate us about the importance of identifying 
and protecting ceremonial landscapes that are important to their people and 
scattered throughout our public and private forest lands.  And, most of them 
are not identified or protected in any way. 
 
 
 
29 
 
 
So, that’s the first recommendations, if any of my co-chairs want 
to add any. 
 
 
The second recommendation is that DEP should be directed to 
commence a formal rulemaking process for the development of forest-
management plans on public lands.  One of the things that we learned -- and, 
we actually had a subcommittee of folks who really dug in to try to 
understand what rules and regulations apply to our public forest lands -- and, 
one of the things we learned and kind of came to agreement on is that outside 
of natural areas, in the Pinelands for example, there are no formal rules or 
regulations governing forest-management plans on our public forest lands.  
The DEP does follow a 14-step internal process for forest-management plans, 
but that process does not exist in statute or rule.  So, it could be changed, by 
a future administration for example. 
 
 
And, everyone agreed there should be -- these are our public 
forest lands we’re talking about, and there should be a formal process 
governing forest-management plans on our public lands.  It should be done 
in accordance with the New Jersey Administrative Procedures Act, and it 
should be done within three years, which I neglected to note.  The planning 
process that I referenced in Recommendation 1 -- our feeling is that that 
should be completed within three years as well.  This is a significant 
undertaking to map, analyze, plan for the entirety of our public forest lands. 
The rulemaking process should be on a similar timeline and be informed by 
that planning process. 
 
 
If anybody wants to add here? 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, just one thing. 
 
 
 
30 
 
 
We emphasize (indiscernible) of robust public process to be 
inherent in this rulemaking.  And, that came up quite a bit-- 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Absolutely-- 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  --during our discussions, and we need to include 
that here. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Right. 
 
 
Of course, the Administrative Procedures Act would require that.  
But, it’s an important point to highlight, Eileen. 
 
 
The third recommendation is -- again, recognizing that the first 
two steps are going to take quite some time to do them right -- is that there 
should be an interim rulemaking, completed within a year, that would govern 
how forest-management plans are developed while this longer planning and 
rulemaking process is being carried out.  Again, that should follow the New 
Jersey Administrative Procedures Act.  It should apply to state lands, as well 
as significant forested parcels of county or municipal lands. 
 
 
And, then, second, we had some conversation -- OK, so what 
happens during that one-year interim period?  And, we agreed that once that 
rulemaking process begins, any newly initiated plans should not be approved, 
either for that one-year period or until the rules are adopted -- whichever 
comes first.  So, we couldn’t have an indefinite delay, so, we agreed on a one-
year period, and the hope would be that the Department would be able to do 
an interim rulemaking within a year to at least have a sufficient process to 
govern the development of forest-management plans while the lengthier 
planning and rulemaking process was being carried out. 
 
 
And, also, we thought there should be some exceptions to deal 
with, obviously, any emergency scenario; to deal with fire management; to 
 
 
 
31 
deal with invasive species.  There should be some exceptions if there’s a need 
for new management activities for those circumstances in the interim, those 
should be permitted. 
 
 
If anybody wants to add something here. 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  Just add one thing real quick. 
 
 
So, we were specific about how we said this one-year kind of 
hiatus is on newly initiated plans.  So, it’s not going to interfere or interrupt 
with existing plans that are already in place and approved. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Thanks, Andy. 
 
 
The next recommendation is that the DEP should be directed to 
revitalize and implement the existing Natural Areas Program. 
 
 
Just a brief word of background on this program if you’re not 
familiar with it:  It was established in 1961, later amended in statute in 1975, 
with a goal of protecting lands in a natural condition and in particular areas 
that support rare species.  There are 44 natural areas around the state, with 
a total of over 40,000 acres.  The problem is, the program is on life support.  
And, this is something that we heard from the DEP -- I mean, I think this 
was straight from their mouths in terms of the status of the program -- there 
hasn’t been a new natural area designated since 2004.  There’s little to no 
staffing for the program.  Many of the natural areas that have management 
plans, those plans are not being implemented.  Many of the natural areas that 
have been designated don’t even have management plans.  There is a Natural 
Areas Council that has vacancies that have not been filled. 
 
 
So, the program desperately needs to be revitalized with 
increased funding, staffing, and appointments to fill the vacant seats, in order 
to fulfill the original vision and mission of the program.  We need 
 
 
 
32 
implementation of the existing management plans, and we need management 
plans for the areas that don’t have them. 
 
 
And, also, the planning process noted in Recommendation 1 
should identify additional natural areas that should be designated on public 
lands, including, in particular, the natural heritage priority sites that are sites 
that are very important for biological diversity and are prime candidates to 
be considered as natural areas. 
 
 
And, it goes without saying, all of this is going to require more 
resources, and this is going to be a theme throughout our recommendations.  
Many of these things that we’re pointing to just simply won’t happen without 
additional resources and staff (indiscernible). 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  I want to kind of camp out here for a minute, 
because this was probably, for me, one of the most significant moments on 
this Task Force, was a meeting we had when we invited -- as Tom said, the 
DEP shared all this, kind of the current state of affairs of the Natural Areas 
Program, and they shared this information with us. 
 
 
And, I’ll be honest, I didn’t know a whole lot about the program, 
but as I was listening, it was very discouraging because these natural areas are 
our kind of highest and best resource value areas.  They’re set aside for a 
particular reason, whether they have some endangered plant or rare plant 
species; endangered wildlife species; whatever it might be, they’ve set it aside.  
We’ve preserved it, we’ve protected it, we’ve set up a plan on some of them -
- we don’t have a plan on any of them -- but, then, the worst part is none of 
the plans have been executed.  None of the plans have been carried out. 
 
 
So, what does that mean?  Well, we know that a natural area or 
any forest, it’s dynamic -- it changes every day, right?  There’s always things 
 
 
 
33 
happening.  So, just preserving that natural area doesn’t mean that it’s going 
to exist just like that in perpetuity.  It needs maintenance, potentially; it 
needs care. 
 
 
I’ll use a quick personal example.  On my family property, we 
have a conservation easement with the USDA because we have the 
endangered species the bog turtle on our property, OK.  We regularly go in 
and do some maintenance and manipulation of vegetation to make sure that 
that habitat continues to work for the bog turtle. 
 
 
So, these natural areas are no different than that.  They need 
maintenance; they need help.  And, as Tom said, we’re going to get to that. 
Recommendation 16 is all about funding.  And, to give you a real-life example 
of that, you’ve heard of the Atlantic White Cedar Restoration Project that I 
believe has commenced.  That’s a project covering 10,000 acres to restore 
and help an ecosystem that’s very uncommon, very rare -- $20 million over 
10 years, over 10,000 acres.  That’s what it takes for the Atlantic White Cedar 
Project.  So, it’s not a small amount that is going to be required to treat these 
areas and to care for them properly and steward them. 
 
 
And, in summary, I just would say we’ve been asleep on the job, 
so to speak; we’ve neglected it.  And, I think, to DEP’s defense, I’ve met a lot 
of their people -- they have some really good people.  But, the common theme 
is they’re short on bodies and they’re short on resources.  So, I think that 
Recommendation 16 is going to be very, very important as part of this 
package. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  OK, continuing to Recommendation 5. 
 
 
The DEP should be directed to identify areas where afforestation 
and reforestation should occur on public lands.  It should be done as part of 
 
 
 
34 
the inventory and planning process, and informed by that process, and should 
include measures needed to ensure success consistent with our carbon 
sequestration goals that are identified in the New Jersey DEP Global 
Warming Response Act 80 by 50 Report, which includes reforestation and 
afforestation. 
 
 
And, I just want to reference that 80 by 50 Report, because a lot 
of the recommendations in that report are consistent with our 
recommendations.  I wish we could have spent more time on this report, 
frankly, talking about climate -- we didn’t, but I want to point out their 
recommendations on afforestation; reforestation of pasture and crop land; 
reforestation of wetland and other lands; urban reforestation; and, agri-
forestry.  All four of these tasks are very doable in the State of New Jersey, 
and they get at this recommendation Number 5 that we show in our 
framework.  So, I just wanted to emphasize that connection there. 
 
 
The sixth-- 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Eileen, can I add one thing real quick? 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t--  Yes. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Super quick, just so people understand what the 
carbon goals are that are indebted in that DEP Global Warming Response 
Act Report. 
 
 
They estimate that -- these are 2018 figures.  New Jersey’s land 
sector -- and, that’s not just forest:  forest, wetlands, ag. lands -- sequester the 
equivalent of 8.1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, which is 8% of New 
Jersey’s net emissions.  So, it’s not insignificant when you’re talking about 
(indiscernible) net emissions.  They also project that -- they count on 
maintaining that carbon sequestration across those various land types and 
 
 
 
35 
increasing it by up to 10.8 million metric tons, which would be a 33% 
increase.  And, one of the most promising strategies to identify there is 
reforestation, as Eileen noted. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Sixth. 
 
 
The DEP should be directed to establish a new program within 
the agency to designate carbon reserves, as identified again through that 
planning process, with a primary goal of protecting mature forests and 
providing for future all-growth forests, as defined by the Science Advisory 
Panel, which we defined in the Recommendation 1, for the carbon benefit. 
 
 
Now, this particular recommendation is our attempt to address 
the proforestation issue.  Certainly, there are areas in the state that we should 
leave alone.  We preserve those lands.  Should it be every acre of forested 
land in the state?  That might be where we participants disagree, but certainly 
some, and they should be reserved as carbon reserves. 
 
 
So, that’s -- this was our attempt to address that particular 
concern that we heard frequently among participants. 
 
 
If anybody else wants to add to this. 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Yes, I just want to add that this 
recommendation, particularly, is something kind of new, because the DEP 
has not taken a look at forest management within the lines of climate change.  
So, setting aside carbon reserves is one of the most important 
recommendations, because it’s just simply not been done before. 
 
 
So, we feel very proud about this. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, that’s a big one. 
 
 
And, seven, the DEP should be directed to identify areas where 
active management is needed, to promote future carbon sequestration, 
 
 
 
36 
maintain biodiversity, and to address current and future threats to ecological 
health.  It’s kind of a compliment to the one before.  In some areas, we want 
to leave alone, we want carbon reserves; in other areas, they need some active 
management in order to better sequester carbon, as well as maintain other 
ecological goals. 
 
 
So, these are kind of like the yin and the yang of active 
management to proforestation, if you will. 
 
 
Any comment? 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  I want to add something. 
 
 
I just want to add that whatever is set aside as a carbon reserve 
or as an area that needs active management, it’ll all be informed based on the 
inventory, which is Recommendation Number 1. 
 
 
So, that’s truly what’s going to dictate what needs help, what 
needs a little bit more management, or what has the potential for 
(indiscernible). 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, and, also, I forgot to mention “active 
management” is listed as one of the techniques in that 80 by 50 Report for 
carbon sequestration active management. 
 
 
And, then Recommendation 8-- 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  Can I just add one thing there, Eileen? 
 
 
In particular, there’s a lot of focus on the Pinelands, with regard 
to the need for dealing with a lot density of the forests in the Pinelands, and 
the risk of catastrophic wildfire as a result of that. 
 
 
So, in a lot of respects, it’s a carbon defense strategy, because if 
we have massive catastrophic wildfires, then that’s going to result in a larger 
release of carbon and loss of carbon storage. 
 
 
 
37 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Good point. 
 
 
OK, and my final one is the DEP must recognize the importance 
of adaptive management during that inventory and planning process, and, I 
think Andy alluded to this. 
 
 
As your land changes, your techniques to manage that land must 
also necessarily change.  You adapt your management approaches over time 
based on new data and the changing circumstances of our forest. 
 
 
And, we recommend that the planning and inventory be updated 
at least every 10 years.  That’s consistent with a New Jersey Forest Action 
Plan, which is updated every 10 years, so we wanted to be consistent. 
 
 
So, after the first inventory and planning exercise, we propose 
that 10 years from then we re-visit it. 
 
 
Any additions? 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Just one addition. 
 
 
The adaptive management is especially important because of 
climate change.  Our ecosystems are continuously changing because of the 
impacts of climate change, so we should always be looking at the new data 
and the new science so that we keep up and we manage the forests correctly. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  OK, moving right along, we’re on Number 9 -- 
Recommendation 9. 
 
 
It says the New Jersey DEP must recognize the significant 
variation in our forests, both on a macro level and micro level, as a guiding 
principle of the planning and rulemaking process. 
 
 
So, this was just to acknowledge there’s obvious differences 
between the Highlands and the Pinelands.  But, it’s even deeper than that.  
There’s differences from county to county; from township to township; and 
 
 
 
38 
from property to property.  It’s very site specific, and that’s what we’re getting 
at here, is acknowledging those differences. 
 
 
Good?  OK. 
 
 
All right, now we’re going to move onto the next section of the 
framework.  The first section -- what did we call the first section, guys? I can’t 
remember.  That was a long time ago-- 
 
 
MR. BENNETT: Statewide inventory-- 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Inventory-- 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  OK. 
 
 
So, statewide inventory and planning.  This is more getting 
down, 
boots-on-the-ground, 
forest-management 
planning 
and 
implementation. 
 
 
So, recommendation Number 10:  New Jersey DEP must protect 
and manage New Jersey’s public forest lands to maintain and enhance carbon 
sequestration and storage as necessary to advance State climate goals while 
advancing equally important goals of ecological health, biological diversity, 
climate resiliency, and protection of water and soil resources, while providing 
low-intensity, safe public recreation opportunities. 
 
 
And, Tom kind of got at this when he was talking about the 
dissenting opinions.  There were some folks who thought the focus of this 
should be solely on climate goals, but we kind of -- the supermajority was 
more in favor of, yes, climate, yes, carbon, but also all of these other things, 
right -- ecological health, biological diversity, etc., etc. 
 
 
So, anything to add on 10, guys? 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, I’ll just add one thing. 
 
 
 
39 
 
 
We did also hear people wanted us to get specific about the tools 
that you use for forest management.  Whereas, we thought that was better 
left to the science advisory panel and the experts that were implementing any 
of the management decisions that were made. 
 
 
What we proposed here is that the goals -- the goals should be 
clearly established, and, then, the tools to reach those goals would be 
determined individually by each individual management plan. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Yes, helpful point, too, I should have mentioned 
this. 
 
 
As you continue reading, it says, “Planning and inventory should 
guide the prioritization of management goals in specific areas, recognizing 
that these goals would be achieved across the aggregate of acres owned by the 
State, rather than on one single acre.”  So, that’s just acknowledging that on 
one single acre, you can’t do everything, OK.  There’s tradeoff -- you have to 
pick one or the other.  What are we going to focus on here or there? 
 
 
OK, Recommendation 11.  New Jersey DEP forest-management 
plans on public land must be developed in accordance with the process 
established through rulemaking noted in the previous section.  So, nothing 
new there, we’re just referencing back to Recommendations 2 and 3 which 
spell that out. 
 
 
OK, Number 12.  New Jersey DEP should continue to use fire as 
an important management tool based upon sound science.  The most 
significant action the agency could take on this issue is to fully implement 
the Prescribed Burn Act, which outlines processes for the use of prescribed 
burning as an effective tool for forest management and public safety.  So, this 
is -- I think when we think of fire, we think of prescribed fire; automatically 
 
 
 
40 
we relate it to the Pinelands and we think about catastrophic fire, reducing 
fire risks.  But, there are instances where prescribed fire can be used as a 
management tool to promote a certain type of forest or whatever it might be.  
So, this is encouraging the forest fire service to utilize fire to train other 
people to use fire on the landscape. 
 
 
Anything else to add, guys, on that one?  (no response) 
 
 
No?  OK. 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  OK, so, I am going to take you all 
through the last four recommendations.  Recommendations 13 and 14 
basically look at, specifically, into invasive species, and also the problem that 
we have in New Jersey with the abundant deer population. 
 
 
So, Recommendation 13:  The New Jersey DEP should be 
directed to amplify efforts to address the impacts of invasive, non-native 
species, including insects, animals, plants, pathogens, and microorganisms.  
These efforts include reconvening the New Jersey Invasive Species Council 
created in 2004 but currently dormant; very similar to the Natural Areas 
Program.  And, charging them with abating and implementing a statewide 
and strategic plan to address the issue.  The New Jersey DEP should develop 
regional collaborations with neighboring states, including Pennsylvania and 
New York, and other regions that have addressed this issue.  
 
 
In addition, the proposals -- which you can all find in Appendix 
E in the report -- approved by the Task Force participants include directing 
the Legislature to do the following:  Consider passing legislation that 
establishes and funds a youth conservation corps, with a focus on invasive 
species removal and increased funding for New Jersey DEP -- excuse me -- the 
 
 
 
41 
New Jersey Department of Agriculture Alampi Lab to expand their work on 
invasive species control. 
 
 
On really good news on invasive species -- as we were finalizing 
our report, thanks to Senator Greenstein’s leadership, as well as Senator 
Smith, they introduced a bill to do this same thing, which is to get a handle 
of the invasive species in New Jersey, to prohibit the sale of invasive species 
for residents in New Jersey.  And, so, we were really, really happy.  We created 
a separate -- with the Task Force, everybody was really eager to participate, 
everybody -- it was a consensus item, essentially, which we were really excited 
about that.   
 
 
But, we presented testimony, and we were incredibly excited to 
see that right then and there during the Senate Environment and Energy 
Committee, the bill got amended to reintroduce the Invasive Species Council.  
So, it hasn’t passed full legislature, but we’re very excited and we’re going to 
push that through.  So, thank you Senator Greenstein and Senator Smith for 
that. 
 
 
Recommendation 14-- 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Oh, wait, I want to say one more thing. 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Oh, yes, please. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  I just wanted to add that the people who 
testified on behalf of the Task Force on that invasive species bill were 
participants.  We didn’t (indiscernible) -- it was participants in this Task 
Force that did that.  We’re so happy -- we were very, very pleased with that. 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  Can I just-- 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, please. 
 
 
 
42 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  There’s a couple specific things here that, I 
guess, are not addressed in that bill -- which is terrific -- that also are worth 
consideration, which is establishing and funding a youth conservation corps 
with a focus on invasive species removal and increasing funding for the New 
Jersey Department of Ag. Alampi Lab to expand their work on invasive 
species control. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  And, the Alampi Lab, for those of you who don’t 
know, they focus on research on invasives.  So, that’s-- 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Biological-- 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Yes, biological -- thank you, Tom. 
 
 
So, that’s why it’s very important to provide funding to this 
research place. 
 
 
OK, so Recommendation 14:  The New Jersey DEP should be 
directed to measure and reduce deer densities in our public forest lands to 
ecological sustainable levels, with guidance from the Science Advisory Panel.  
We are all very much aware that we have a deer population problem in New 
Jersey.  It impacts us in our cars, but it also impacts our forests pretty 
significantly. 
 
 
So, specifically, the New Jersey DEP should identify and 
implement new and innovative steps -- and, we say this because the actions 
that have been taken thus far are clearly not working -- such as establishing a 
pilot program for the commercial sale of venison; exploring the role of natural 
predators in deep forest; providing a stable source of funding for Hunters 
Helping the Hungry; implementing fertility control, including sterilization; 
and considering revisions to current guidelines on baiting and feeding -- for 
example, (indiscernible).  New Jersey DEP should evaluate these and other 
 
 
 
43 
steps with public input and report back with recommendations to the 
Legislature within a year.  We consider this a pretty significant issue, so we 
think that the New Jersey DEP can report back to the Legislature within a 
year. 
 
 
I want to add, for a little bit of background:  In many of our 
public forest lands, deer densities are as much as 10 times greater than is 
needed to ensure forest regeneration and the survival of native plant species.  
What happens is that when we are actively planting native species in our 
forests, they have the threat of deer eating them and not really providing the 
opportunity for these plant species to regrow.  So, it’s a very serious problem, 
and one that everybody faces within the forestry community. 
 
 
Does anybody want to add anything?  Co-Chairs?  (no response) 
 
 
Recommendation 15:  The New Jersey DEP should not include 
commercial profit as a goal in any forest-management plan on public land.  
Commercial timber management should not be a goal for any forest-
management plan on public land.  Wood products can be sold in instances 
where cutting and removal of wood is a necessary part of the approved plan 
with ecological help, climate, or non-commercial goals. 
 
 
So, what this does is if and when you have to cut a tree -- if and 
when you have to remove that tree -- this only allows for the commercial sale 
of that piece of wood, with the objectives of ecological health.  That 
commercial -- making profit out of wood products should never be the 
objective of the (indiscernible) management plan.  And, I’m going to provide 
an example of this.  I think it was by Andy, Atlantic white cedar restoration.  
For the Atlantic white cedar to regrow effectively, you have to remove wood 
 
 
 
44 
from the soil.  So, in this case, the ecological objective dictates that you have 
to remove the wood. 
 
 
And, so, what do you do with that wood?  You can compost it, 
which can release carbon to the atmosphere, or, other instances -- you don’t 
want to throw it to a landfill, so, in those theories, special small instances, it 
is OK to sell that wood. 
 
 
Recommendation 16:  The Legislature and others must identify 
and implement funding mechanisms to ensure success of recommendations 
in this report.  This gets to what Andy -- well, pretty much everybody was 
saying -- that this framework cannot be done correctly if the DEP does not 
receive funding so that they can employ staff to really do these -- conduct 
these programs and do these activities correctly. 
 
 
Many elements and goals of this framework can now move 
forward without significant resources and staffing to the DEP.  All 
recommendations discussed above require funding in the form of staffing and 
resources in order to be successful.  Funding should include increased 
appropriations via the annual state budget; new state funding sources; 
external brands; programs; and, other government entities that can assist the 
agency in completing these goals.  Specifically, and immediately, the 
legislature and agencies should direct funding from the Federal Inflation 
Reduction Act to advance initiatives in this framework.  Proposals -- some of 
the proposals that actually, we reached consensus, which can be found in the 
appendix E in the report -- approved related to new funding sources include:  
Increased block rate pricing on water use to recognize the impact of forest 
protections on availability of clean water; extending the realty transfer fee 
progression to sales of homes of $1 million and above; relocation of Green 
 
 
 
45 
Acres funding to include management activities; and -- sorry -- and, tapping 
carbon markets, including the RGGI funding, and other Federal funding 
sources. 
 
 
And, that is the end of the framework recommendations, and, I 
believe the end of our-- 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  That concludes our presentation-- 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Yes-- 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  --and, we’re happy to take questions. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  So, we would like to ask you some 
questions, OK, and give everybody on the panel a chance to ask. 
 
 
But, let me first note the presence of Senator Greenstein, who 
has arrived, and our Co-Chair on the Assembly side, Assemblyman Kennedy. 
 
 
And, Assemblyman Kennedy, if it’s OK, we’ll open up to 
questions from the members. 
 
 
Does anybody have a question for the Task Force? 
 
 
Yes, sir. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN SCHARFENBERGER:  Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, and thank you for your unbelievable effort in this undertaking 
here. 
 
 
Just a little clarification about the term “logging.”  When you say 
logging, is that live trees, or felled trees, or a combination of both? 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  So, yes, logging is just simply the removal of 
trees, whether they were felled with a chainsaw -- if they came down in 
Hurricane Sandy, logging would be the removal of those trees. 
 
 
 
46 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN SCHARFENBERGER:  OK, so, would we look 
at standing trees, I guess, for lack of a better term, versus dead trees on the 
floor differently?  You know, within logging requirements? 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  I think it depends on who you ask.  For some, 
any removal of any piece of wood is unacceptable, and that’s logging.  And, 
then, for others, it’s a more active process where you cut the tree and then 
you sell it. 
 
 
So, it depends on who you ask, I think. 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Well, you cut the tree, and then there’s 
a second step, which is removal from the soil.  (indiscernible) sometimes you 
cut the tree and you let it decompose; sometimes, the ecological objectives 
require just that, to just let the tree on the soil. 
 
 
So, it’s the two steps. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN SCHARFENBERGER:  OK. 
 
 
And, I guess, a logical question is, who is going to decide in what 
case what would apply?  Whether it’s a felled tree or a living tree -- who is 
going to decide that, ultimately? 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  So, that should be based on the management 
plans that are in place for the particular land unit that’s in question, and what 
we’re trying to do is put some parameters in place so that, first off, there’s a 
scientifically based planning process that underlies all those forest-
management plans. 
 
 
Second, there’s a forest-management plan that’s developed in 
keeping with the rulemaking that’s established to govern how forest-
management plans are put together, and shows the nexus to the planning and 
science.  But, then, ultimately, it’s the land managers -- whether it’s State 
 
 
 
47 
land; if it’s the DEP; or it’s county land -- that are then carrying out and 
implementing those plans and making those decisions in accordance with the 
over-arching plan and the management plan for the specific unit. 
 
 
And, then, what we recommended is that the parameter include 
that wood products should not be removed, whether it’s live or downed, 
unless it’s necessary to achieve an ecological objective that was established in 
that forest-management plan. 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  I want to add something to that 
question; thanks. 
 
 
I just completely lost my train of thought -- oh, it just came back. 
 
 
So, all of these management plans and this rulemaking and this 
entire process will have, essentially, a third-party involved, which is the 
Scientific Advisory Panel.  And, so, these management plans are dictated by 
science.  And, so, an outside voice, in addition to the DEP, will ultimately 
make those decisions (indiscernible) kind of gave (indiscernible) etc. 
 
 
So, it’s a robust process, with the input of experts. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  And, logging, per se, is not a legitimate goal for 
any forested land.  That was our Recommendation 15, that the commercial 
sale of wood should never, ever be the goal on a piece of land. 
 
 
However, if you have a management tool -- I mentioned this 
before -- that involves cutting a tree, part of your management plan for 
ecological purposes is to cut a tree, then you may sell it -- you can remove it 
and sell it as long as the ecological purposes have been withheld. 
 
 
But, commercial gain should never be a goal on any land. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN SCHARFENBERGER:  Thank you very 
much, thank you, miss. 
 
 
 
48 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Excuse me. 
 
 
On that statement, you said the commercial should not have  
any--  So, you’re telling a private owner of a land should not be able to sell 
their trees? 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  No, no, public land-- 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  See, I have a problem with when 
government tells private ownership what they can and can’t do. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Senator, this is policy for public lands only. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Well, I wanted to ask a couple questions. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Sure. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  I didn’t hear the word -- now, I’ve heard this 
term before, so, correct me if I’m wrong -- but clearcutting, as far as preserving 
the forest.  Where does that play a part in this, and, also, what are we doing 
about reforestation?  Do we have a program set up in that regard? 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  So, what was your question about clearcutting? 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  I didn’t hear this in the comments, talking 
about--  With clearcutting, that’s clearly removal of the wood, you know?  
You’re going to be cutting it down and you’re going to be removing it.  You’re 
not going to just cut it down and leave it on the floor, because that kind of 
defeats the purpose. 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  At times.  So, there are-- 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Would you want -- you want to thin it out, 
just like anything, because we hear it all the time with these Pine Barrens 
forest fires, you know, that it’s over-forestation that causes the growth on the 
floor, and all the fallen trees. 
 
 
So, where is this going to play a part in it? 
 
 
 
49 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  So, I don’t know.  I would just say that 
clearcutting is, what we call in forestry, a silvicultural practice. 
 
 
So, there are certain techniques you use in the management of 
the forest -- and, they’re described by different terms.  One would be 
clearcutting; that would be taking all of the trees.  Doesn’t necessarily mean 
they’re all removed.  There are times when trees are cut, felled, you’re making 
a mess with the intent to create habitat for wildlife. 
 
 
So, there’s different goals, different objectives, and that’s where 
clearcutting could come into play if there was a certain objective you were 
trying to accomplish. 
 
 
And, what was the other -- what was the other question? 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  The other part -- where does reforestation 
come in?  I’ve heard so many times that for every tree that’s taken down, 
they plant two seedlings to regrow the forest. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  So, one of our recommendations -- excuse me   
-- does focus on and call for reforestation as an important strategy, with 
respect to the State’s land sequestration goals. 
 
 
And, Eileen talked about some of the different types of 
reforestation projects that are identified in the DEP report.  I would think, 
for public forest lands, some of the opportunities might include -- and, this is 
referenced in the DEP report -- planting trees in understocked areas; so, we 
have some areas of forest where, in the pines and many areas, it’s too dense.  
But, we’ve got other forests where they’re not, you know, fully stocked, and 
there’s opportunity to actually increase the density and, thus, the carbon 
storage and some of our understocked forest lands on public lands. 
 
 
 
50 
 
 
But -- and, I would also note that you’ve got to deal with the deer 
issue, one of the other recommendations.  So-- 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Increase hunting.  (laughter) 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  That and many other things, I think, is kind of 
what we’re pointing to. 
 
 
But, unless we deal with the deer issue, we’re not going to have 
success in reforestation because they’re going to eat -- they’re already eating 
everything, and we don’t have the forest regeneration in a lot of our forests.  
Any efforts at reforestation would fail-- 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Well, we’re an overgrowth state, and, so, as 
we continue to grow out, the area for deer shrinks.  So, we have to consider 
that, too.  
 
 
The one other question I did have -- and, I know -- where does 
the Legislature play a part in this?  Because I see all these recommendations 
for the DEP -- why wasn’t the DEP asked to join us in this event? 
 
 
Because, other than writing a check, I haven’t seen you mention 
the Legislature in this. 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Well, writing the check is very 
important.  (laughter) 
 
 
So, that’s an excellent question, Senator.  But, currently, as 
mentioned at the beginning of the framework, there are no existing rules for 
our public lands or forests aside from the Highlands and comprehensive rules 
for the pines. 
 
 
So, this would allow for these rules to -- well, for the direction 
via statute-- 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Laws, right -- laws that legislators write? 
 
 
 
51 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Right, exactly.  (laughter) 
 
 
To be in statute so that the DEP has to commit to developing 
these rules, so that there is an authority and mechanism to employ all of these 
activities (indiscernible) some accountability. 
 
 
So, having it in statutes is a significant step so that the DEP has 
the authority to do so. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Again, laws that the Legislature writes that 
the DEP follows the laws? 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Yes. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  OK. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Exactly. 
 
 
And, some of these are new ideas, like establishing carbon 
reserves -- that’s a new concept that needs to be created and embodied in 
statute to give the DEP the direction, the authority to go ahead and move 
forward on that idea, for example. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Thank you. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Other members with questions?  (no 
response) 
 
 
All right, then I have two. 
 
 
Unfair question:  What is this going to cost? 
 
 
(laughter) 
 
 
Do you have any estimates? 
 
 
And, one thing we’re doing, when we were going through the 
recommendations, it became clear that one of our rules may be to check.  So, 
I’m asking staff to write to the Commission with a copy of the report saying 
what would each item cost. 
 
 
 
52 
 
 
But, as a panel or as a group, have you thought about what the 
cost would be?  Any ballpark ideas? 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  We really didn’t try to put a number on it, 
Senator, and honestly I think--  And, the question about DEP. 
 
 
So, DEP was very involved in these conversations-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Sure-- 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  --and, we appreciate the time that they spent.  
They were there as an informational resource; they provided background on 
the current status of various efforts; and answered questions. 
 
 
Honestly, I think the DEP would be in the best position to 
answer that question and try to come up, put a number on what kind of 
personnel and staffing and other resources are needed to-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  We’re soliciting that. 
 
 
The other question is related to your comments, the less we get 
the deer population under control, proforestation is not going to happen -- 
or, it’s not going to happen very well. 
 
 
Would you elaborate on that?  Why are deer the public enemy 
Number 1 for the forest? 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Great question, Senator. 
 
 
So, it’s that stat that I mentioned earlier, which is the deer 
population for proper regrowth of our forests is 10 times greater than what a 
sustainable population should be. 
 
 
So, that is a significant number, and it’s very difficult to control.  
I mean, I know that some management areas or management plans that 
require fencing to keep deer outside, so you can have regrowth -- Tom can 
speak to this at length. 
 
 
 
53 
 
 
But, it’s just 10 times greater; it’s just too much, too many deer. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Excuse me, just real quick. 
 
 
Is it deer are 10 times greater, or they have 10 times less land 
mass to operate on?  Because, you know, that’s kind of what we’re really 
talking about.  We shrank to the land that they are operating on. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  So, let me be helpful-- 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  It’s both-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Senator, let me be helpful. 
 
 
We’ve been working with the New Jersey Farm Bureau for years.  
Farmers in this state have a huge -- besides everybody else having a problem 
with deer -- farmers have an amazingly large problem.  And, they’ve actually 
been doing surveys -- you can’t do all the square miles in the State of New 
Jersey, but you can pick out an area, count the number of deer, and 
extrapolate. 
 
 
And, the Farm Bureau says the following:  First, that there are 
more deer in New Jersey than there are people.  Secondly, they point out 
there’s 30,000 accidents a year in New Jersey involving deer and human 
beings. And, then, thirdly -- and, they don’t have to point it out -- is the 
problem with deer as vectors of disease.  Not just tickborne, but a whole 
bunch of other diseases as well. 
 
 
The problem that I was trying to post more information about    
-- the reason why they’re so deadly to reforestation:  They eat the saplings; 
the seedlings; whatever.  You put a small tree, a young tree, that’s like a 
garden salad for deer.  They just do it. 
 
 
So, the question is:  Can we do reforestation or proforestation 
without some very significant reduction in the deer population? 
 
 
 
54 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  Not at a large scale, no. 
 
 
I mean, there are techniques to do reforestation in small areas, 
and to fence those areas, or to do tubing on the trees and so forth. 
 
 
So, it can be done on a small scale, but not at a large scale. 
 
 
And, Senator, you are absolutely correct.  We would be happy to 
take any member of the Committee out into the woods and show you many, 
many areas where there is literally no regeneration on the forest floor.  The 
deer eat everything; they prefer the native species, so sometimes the only 
thing that’s left are the invasive species -- which is one of the other problems 
we’re trying to address -- and, it’s very striking.  We can show you an area 
that’s been fenced, and you see the incredible regeneration.  If you just 
remove the deer through this fencing, you can see incredible forest 
regeneration and recovery of the native species.  Right outside that fence -- 
nothing. 
 
 
It’s very striking, and it’s an enormous -- it’s not going to be an 
easy problem to fix, and it’s going to require some new, innovative, out-of-
the-box thinking.  It’s not just -- back to the Senator, it’s not just more 
hunting that it’s going to require -- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  And, it also adds other impacts to wildlife. 
 
 
Joey, who never sits quietly there, he’s also doing -- a Googler -- 
got a New Jersey Biz article.  It’s from 2020 -- yeah, March 20, 2022 -- and, it 
is reporting that a small group of New Jersey farmers -- actually 27 farmers    
-- documented losing nearly $1.3 million to deer damage in 2019, according 
to the Rutgers Cooperative Extension and Rutgers New Jersey Agricultural 
Experiment Station. 
 
 
 
55 
 
 
And, by the way, that’s just a tiny example.  And, we all love 
Bambi, but the issue here is the damage they do to our forests; to our health; 
to our cars; to our mortality; we really need to take a new look at it. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Senator -- Chairman -- I’m not disagreeing 
with any of your stats on that. 
 
 
Again, this is what I’m saying is, that you do agree, then, 
increased hunting would help.  Lessening the population of deer would help in 
the reforestation. 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  Yes, I think that’s one avenue. 
 
 
I think, again, to our recommendations-- 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  I didn’t say it was the silver bullet that would 
solve it, but it is a step forward.  It’s a positive step, correct? 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  One hundred percent agree. 
 
 
I think we also know -- I’m a deer hunter, my generation doesn’t 
have as many deer hunters as the previous generation, etc., etc. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Yes, because guns are bad. 
 
 
MR. BENNETT:  That’s right. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  (laughter) 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  But, I would just add that we’re going to need 
some changes in hunting policies, because I am not a hunter, but the hunters 
want to take bucks. The hunters don’t want to take does. 
 
 
So, the recreational hunting is not a terribly effective mechanism 
for reducing the deer problem. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Well, that’s where we partner with food 
banks and stuff.  Venison is a good meal to give to the needy. 
 
 
So, it can be done. 
 
 
 
56 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  We agree.  Hunters Helping the Hungry 
program is in there.  We also have in there a recommendation to explore a 
pilot for the commercial sale of venison.  Let’s create a market. 
 
 
Those are -- we’re going to need some game-changing ideas to 
really get a handle on this problem. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  It’s huge. 
Thank you, thank you, and thank you again for all your hard 
work.  You have been enormously helpful to the Legislature. 
 
 
Hopefully, we can figure out a uniform, consistent forestry policy 
for our public lands.  But, again, your work and the work of the 600 people 
who participated has helped tremendously, and we’re hoping that you’re 
going to see some good legislation and make sure that our forests are doing 
the maximum they can for global climate change to prevent it, and, at the 
same time, to make our forests healthy. 
 
 
Thank you so much. 
 
 
We have scheduled three groups to come up and testify.  
Assemblyman Kennedy and I hoped to have everybody out of here by 1:00 
p.m.; it’s 12:42, so -- 
 
 
(laughter) 
  
 
But, we have the three groups.  Let’s get them up. 
 
 
First, for a different point of view, the Highlands Coalition -- 
Elliott Ruga, if you could come on up -- you have several witnesses? 
E L L I O TT   R U G A:  You want them here? 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Well, I would like the Task Force to stay-- 
 
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Should we move? 
 
 
 
57 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  --stay here in the room, so you can hear 
what’s being said. 
 
 
And, Elliott is bringing up -- Elliott is the Policy and 
Communications Director for New Jersey Highlands Coalition.  Leslie Sauer 
is Founder Emeritus of Andropogon Associates.  And, Sara Webb is Director, 
Drew University Preserve. 
 
 
Eliott, why don’t you take the lead on this? 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  Great; thank you for introducing my colleagues, 
that will save me some time, because we don’t have a lot. 
 
 
Thank you, Chairman Smith, and Chairman Kennedy and 
Committee members. 
 
 
My name is Elliott Ruga, I am the Policy and Communications 
Director for the New Jersey Highlands Coalition.  I am here today to 
represent the Coalition’s Natural Heritage Committee, which, for the past 
several years, has become a think tank for developing policies for managing 
New Jersey’s publicly owned forests. 
 
 
And, I am joined by my colleagues Dr. Sara Webb, and Leslie 
Sauer.  Dr. Sharon Wander was going to join us today, but she had a 
household emergency, and her statement is in the package that is being 
handed out to you. 
 
 
Over a dozen members of our Natural Heritage Committee were 
members of the Task Force, and actively participated in all of the meetings, 
including the regulatory and invasive species subcommittee.  Although we 
agree with almost all of the recommendations of the Task Force, where the 
report discusses our opposition, our experiences of those discussions differ 
 
 
 
58 
from their accounts so sharply that it seems we may have been in a different 
meeting. 
 
 
For example, on page 11, the report says that two full meetings 
were devoted to the topic of logging.  What we experienced were two full 
meetings where we attempted to have a robust debate about logging, but the 
Task Force leaders did everything they could to stifle that debate.  The subject 
of logging as a management technique, or canopy opening, or seed tree 
harvest -- and, this should answer your question, Assemblyman 
Scharfenberger -- what we mean is the mechanized harvesting of timber at 
any scale, and wood removal for whatever the circumstance.  This is the major 
controversy that divides us. 
 
 
In the press release announcing the formation of the Task Force, 
Senator Smith, you are quoted as saying, “We assembled this Task Force in 
order to identify and debate the major issues.”  But, after 45 hours of Task 
Force meetings, we are no closer to a resolution on that controversy. 
 
 
It might surprise you that 10 of the 16 of the Task Force 
recommendations were based on proposals our members submitted.  Notably, 
recognition of the fact that there are no duly adopted regulations pertaining 
to the management of State-owned forests -- and, that we need them.  But, 
many other proposals that we submitted, that we know to be sound or 
scientifically supportable, were not accepted for discussion. 
 
 
So, why did we object to the overall framework if we supported 
the majority of the framework?  It is because we cannot compromise on this 
single provision under Recommendation Number 15, which would allow 
wood products to be sold in instances where cutting and removal of wood is 
 
 
 
59 
a necessary part of an improved plan with a goal of ecological health.  This is 
the crucial issue for us. 
 
 
The disturbances by mechanized harvesting of timber, and the 
removal of felled timber, including the need to cut new access roads, causes 
impacts, often devastating, to sensitive ecological components of the forest 
that must be weighed against any so-called ecological goal.  Currently, there 
is no requirement that the impacts of logging on soils, water resources, 
vegetation, wildlife, on carbon capture -- none of these are considered prior 
to the approval of a forest-management plan.  And, I would argue, given the 
climate crisis, that until we understand these impacts, we enact a moratorium 
on logging of the (indiscernible). 
 
 
We also see spurious claims of ecological health used to justify 
the logging element of a forest-stewardship plan.  Originally, the justification 
for the forest-stewardship plan at the Sparta Mountain Wildlife Management 
Area was to create a habitat for the golden-winged warbler -- a bird species 
whose range appears to be moving north, entirely out of New Jersey, perhaps 
under the pressures of climate change.  Are the destruction of existing habitat 
for forest interior wildlife species; the compacting of sensitive forest soils; and 
exposing them to invasion by non-native species and other impacts -- are they 
worth it? 
 
 
The plan has since been amended to say the golden-winged 
warbler is merely an indicator species, that the logging benefits many other 
declining early successional bird species.  But, without an impact analysis, we 
have no understanding whether a management plan will produce a net benefit 
or loss. 
 
 
 
60 
 
 
The surveys of the Task Force participants, regarding tree cutting 
and wood removal that Anjuli discussed earlier, are misleading.  In the survey 
of responses to tree cutting, 66% supported cutting trees only for ecological 
health purposes.  But, without a definition of “ecological health,” it is 
impossible to understand what respondents had in mind when they indicated 
support.  We would have voted yes if the definition was for the most narrow 
of circumstances, and the ecological benefit outweighed the adverse impacts. 
How many respondents voted yes, but with the same threshold of ecological 
health in mind?  It is the same with the wood-removal survey -- how many 
respondents voted in support under the assumption that only the most 
narrow of circumstances were intended? 
 
 
Arguably, the same ambiguity characterizes the vote on the 
overall Task Force framework.  We voted to oppose the framework, despite 
agreeing with a majority of the recommendations, because the one provision 
of Recommendation Number 15 was so crucial.  How many respondents felt 
the same as we, but voted in support?  We don’t know. 
 
 
Our concerns with the process and the results as reported by the 
Task Force leaders are not intended in any way to undermine their efforts.  
They had a nearly impossible and unwieldly task that they executed with 
professionalism and a commitment to their charge.  I do not envy them.  It 
was a charged atmosphere with many strong players with strongly held 
positions.  We believe that Senator Smith attempted to appoint four leaders 
who represented a balance among the prevailing views on forest policy, but, 
for whatever reason, that balance did not quite play out as intended.  There 
was a definite bias in favor of logging as management, and alternative views 
 
 
 
61 
on this matter were suppressed, which is why we appreciate being provided 
an opportunity to present an alternative perspective. 
 
 
And, Senator Smith, we will be sending you a report on that 
alternative perspective. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Thank you. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  So, now I hand it over to Dr. Webb. 
 
 
(applause) 
S A R A   W E B B, Ph.D.:  Thank you very much for the opportunity to 
speak today. 
 
 
I am a Professor Emeritus of Biology and Environmental Studies 
at Drew University.  And, out of concern for what I’ve been seeing in our 
forests, I became involved with this effort to take a much closer look at so-
called stewardship plans and try to limit the logging that’s going on. 
 
 
Someone -- maybe Andy -- mentioned they were spending too 
much time talking about logging, but recall the reason we have this Task 
Force is because of concerns about the logging happening in our public lands.  
And, so, that is front and center for good reasons.  We really should not be 
logging our mature forests in northern New Jersey.  After we log, there’s no 
path back to forests because of the deer and the invasive species.  And, we 
are sacrificing one of our very best defenses against climate when you take 
out mature trees. 
 
 
We should have carbon reserves as one of the points of the 
framework -- the Task Force recommendations -- but all of our public forests 
are wildlife-management areas and parks and forests.  They should be default 
carbon reserves where the trees and soil and intact ecosystem is left alone, in 
our view. 
 
 
 
62 
 
 
But, I’ve been really surprised after 40 years of teaching and 
doing research in our forests to see a steep acceleration of logging in the last 
decade or so.  And, the forest-stewardship plans that proliferate are logging 
plans.  The words “logging,” “clearcutting,” are never used; other words like 
“thinning,” “seed tree silviculture,” “habitat management,” and even 
“stewardship,” and “the young forest initiative” -- these are phrases that are 
used.  But, having been in forestry graduate school, I know logging when I 
see it. 
 
 
There’s an active management sort-of smokescreen, and the 
ecological health phrase as Eliott Ruga mentioned, is also ambiguously used 
and, therefore, I think, confused people in voting on the framework that has 
been proposed by our Task Force leaders. 
 
 
The Forest Task Force report also creates a false dichotomy 
between preventing climate disaster and those who care about ecological 
health, telling us that, if we care about the climate, we’re not paying attention 
to ecological health.  The two go hand in hand.  They’re both threatened by 
logging in our mature northern New Jersey forests.  On the first day of the 
Task Force, there was a straw poll on Zoom and 85% of the participants voted 
for no more logging on our public lands.  But, logging was not on the ballot 
or any of the surveys, and it’s not questioned or discussed in the final report, 
so this is puzzling. 
 
 
So, here’s the thing:  There’s two major problems with logging 
management.  One is the loss of planet defense.  And, I know that you are all 
very engaged in that effort on behalf of New Jersey and the planet.  The other 
problem is the failure of trees to grow back.  After we clearcut -- and, they 
don’t call it clearcutting, but it is, you look at it on the ground -- trees don’t 
 
 
 
63 
come back because of the deer and the invasive species.  So, those are serious 
problems.  Young Forest Initiative is optimistic thinking if we log out our 
swaths of mature forests as our agencies are doing, that a young forest will 
return.  But this does not return healthy and vibrant young forests -- the 
forests do not return.  Any young trees that sprouted are eaten by deer or 
choked out by invasive species, and there’s just no path back to forest.  So, 
this Young Forest Initiative doesn’t really work in northern New Jersey. 
 
 
So, controlling the deer and the invasive species is very difficult, 
and we all are on board with doing what we can to protect our forests.  We 
have to be realistic about how expensive it is on doing forest restoration.  
(indiscernible) university forest reserve, these last 15 years, and it’s incredibly 
expensive to put deer fencing around just 50 acres, never mind all of our 
public lands, and that’s what is necessary.  But, we still have a systematic 
clearcutting of one expanse after another of our state lands, and this is really 
something that we should not be doing. 
 
 
Let me talk about the problem with trees not growing back -- 
well, I’ve already talked about that, that’s really a big problem, why we 
shouldn’t be clearing the canopy. 
 
 
The second is the climate defense that is served to us by our 
intact, mature forests.  They absorb and store huge amounts of carbon in the 
ecosystem; in the soil; in their wood.  Much more than the young trees, 
contrary to what we often see per-tree, per-acre -- this is in proportion to their 
leaf area, they’re bringing in carbon; they’re cleaning the air much more 
cheaply than these high-tech equipment efforts that are being developed.  
And, our largest, oldest trees absorb and store far more carbon than younger 
trees per-acre, per-tree, per-year. 
 
 
 
64 
 
 
There’s a lot of misinformation about that point, and I have put 
together a list of scientific peer-reviewed sources that address these issues.  I 
believe a copy of them is in your packets I sent along to Senator Zwicker at 
his request recently.  And, you will see the huge amount of evidence against 
logging -- it’s not directly that -- it’s the evidence that our mature intact 
forests are really important for protecting us from climate change and that 
the logging practices underway are not helping us in that defense, but hurting 
us. 
 
 
So, we don’t have any future forests after we log, we lose carbon-
sequestration services.  We scientists have visited these New Jersey public 
forests before and after logging, and we count over 100 tree rings, both rings 
on stumps -- the stumps aren’t hollow, the trees were healthy; there are deep 
roots; the wood is removed with all of the carbon and habitat value that it 
carries.  That’s what we should be doing on our natural lands, is leaving the 
wood there.  We need timber, but not from our public conservation lands in 
the state with the highest population density and utterly reliant on our forests 
for our very inexpensive and high-quality water. 
 
 
So, in some cases, DEP officials have worked with us and we’ve 
negotiated small changes to some of the logging projects that have been 
proposed.  But, the logging drum beat goes on. 
 
 
So, in conclusion, we just need science to prevail rather than 
tradition.  It’s a tradition to manage our forests by thinning, by cutting out 
large trees, taking away the wood -- that is not right for today’s planet, 
particularly in New Jersey. 
 
 
I know many of you are very involved with climate change on 
behalf of humanity here in New Jersey, and I appreciate that, and I hope that 
 
 
 
65 
today is helpful in shedding light on how much our public conservation 
forests can help the cause. 
 
 
So, thank you very much on the many fronts that you are taking 
strides on to protect New Jersey from harm. 
 
 
Thank you. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  So, I have a question-- 
 
 
(audience applauds) 
 
 
Question for Ms. Webb, or for Elliott -- or, for the Task Force.  
Just so we know what we’re talking about. 
 
 
We divided up the acreage in New Jersey; we said there were 2 
million acres of forested land, half of which -- roughly -- were owned by the 
private sector; half of which were owned by some public sector -- State, 
county, locals, whatever. 
 
 
In the year 2020, 2021, 2022, how many acres of public land 
were clearcut? 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  That’s a good question, Senator Smith. 
 
 
We don’t know because it’s not always public.  Number 1, there’s 
our Green Acres properties on municipal and county level that are being 
logged that we’re not aware of, and right now in the state the only one we 
know about is Sparta Mountain.  But, you remember the bills that were 
introduced two years ago when you-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Yes, yes, yes, but I’m trying to get facts. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  That was the intention. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  My question is, is this a real problem?  
Does our DEP take the 30% of the land that they have and contract for 
clearcutting of wood to be sold? 
 
 
 
66 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  If it wasn’t for us, a lot more that needs-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  But, you don’t have a fact. 
 
 
One of the things we’re doing is, what -- I mean, the great thing 
about this hearing is we’re finding out things we don’t know, all right.  So, 
one item, we’re writing to the DEP commissioners, how much actual New 
Jersey state land was clearcut ’20, ’21, ’22?  And, let’s see the extent of the 
problem.  No one here is for clearcutting.  I don’t see anybody standing up 
with a hand raised, “We’re for clearcutting.”  If anything, we’re here to 
protect the forest.  We’ve all agreed there aren’t any rules and regulations 
about what the criteria should be; we all agree there should be reforestation; 
we all agree there’s a deer problem. 
 
 
I mean, there’s a lot of things that we agree on, but I’d like to 
know if we actually had a problem with the DEP (indiscernible).  This is like 
one of those TV series where we’re -- unfortunately, the popular theme in 
America today is to just say whatever you think, whether you have any facts 
behind it or not. 
 
 
We’re going to ask:  How many acres in the last three years were 
clearcut to our public land, that the DEP authorized, and if they know how 
much was done by counties or how much was done by locals. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  What if they don’t know, Senator? 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Well, we’re going to find out.  We’re going 
to ask the question. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  I mean, we found out about-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  The great thing about your presentation is 
you’re pointing out a real gap in our knowledge--- 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  Yes, well-- 
 
 
 
67 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  --all right. 
 
 
We’re not going to authorize clearcutting.  That is not 
happening. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Chair -- Chairman. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Yes, Senator. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  I think not only should we know how much 
they’ve done, but why they had clearcutting done. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  If they’ve done it-- 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  They need to have the answer of why. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Yes, if they’ve done it. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  If they’ve done it, we want to know why it 
was done. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Yes, and I have to believe--  I mean, we 
have a state with 9.3 million citizens, and most of them are awake.  Now, if 
there was this clearcutting done on public lands, I would have thought we -- 
somebody around the state -- would have heard about it.  Because people 
generally don’t like their forests cut down. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  Senator, I’m trying to answer you. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Go ahead. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  There was Roaring Rock Park in Warren County 
where someone happened to notice what the red ring on the tree meant -- it 
meant it was marked for logging.  A municipal park-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Logging, or is that what Ms. Webb 
described as thinning? 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  No-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  The whole thing coming down? 
 
 
 
68 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  No, this was-- 
 
 
DR. WEBB:  No, it’s not-- 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  This was a clearcutting.  They-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  And, who owned the land? 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  The municipality owned it, and they had a logging 
contract expressly to raise revenue for the municipal budget. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  All right, well, we’re-- 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  And, Green Acres approved it because they said it 
was for conservation. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  We’ll take a look at it. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  OK. 
 
 
Let me introduce Leslie Sauer. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Is your third witness here? 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  Yes. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you said she 
wasn’t. 
L E S L I E   S A U E R:  I would like to speak to the issues of what can the 
Legislature do. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Please. 
 
 
MS. 
SAUER: 
 
Because, 
I 
agree 
that 
many 
of 
the 
recommendations will fall upon DEP, but I think we’re asking way more of 
DEP than they can follow through on.  It took nine years to get 
recommendations for forest-stewardship plans.  They do not have the 
expertise to do a proper inventory and a proper plan for every single park 
before we go ahead and actually make decisions about climate change. 
 
 
 
69 
 
 
I think in order to meet Senator Smith’s goal of actually 
addressing climate change, we have to look at the option of suspending 
logging on public lands only until that work is complete.  It would be a very 
low-cost solution to a very serious problem that is being largely ignored.  It’s 
the only way to take carbon out of the air, and the biggest cost might be in 
funding to consultants and to DEP, but there are lots of other sources, such 
as for reforestation. 
 
 
I would remind you that it’s going to take a thousand trees 
planted probably 30 years to replace one of the big trees logged at Sparta 
Mountain.  The dissenters did not oppose diversity, water quality, wildlife, at 
all, but rather argued that not cutting wood would be a better way to foster 
these goals.  I defy any of them to find one word in the Task Force hearings 
or in any of the proposals that said, “Do not pay attention to these concerns.”  
In fact, virtually all of us who wrote about carbon sequestration also wrote 
about the importance of management in order to maintain quality of our 
forests. 
 
 
We want a higher standard than a forester claiming that cutting 
trees is necessary for ecological health, since that seems to include 
fragmenting our most intact forests; cutting hundreds of trees over 100 years 
of age; and destroying a forest with a laurel understory to make a poor quality 
young forest.  The Task Force also ignored the importance of wood left 
behind.  Having wood taken out for ecological reasons is almost a 
contradiction in terms.  It is the most important builder of the forest food 
web, and is absolutely necessary to developing mature forest conditions. 
 
 
No rules exist presently, and Recommendation 15 covers 
virtually every single project that’s been proposed and opposed in the last 11 
 
 
 
70 
years.  That would include hundreds of acres of Mahlon Dickerson that locals 
stopped; hundreds of acres of Sparta that were stopped; as well as Roaring 
Rocks.  So, in fact, it would have been very much larger if there had not been 
public opposition, and, if we don’t have the support of the Statehouse in 
opposing law, it really becomes very problematic. 
 
 
Forestry is about sustaining wood production -- that’s not what 
we’re interesting in.  We’re interested in the ecological restoration of our 
forest.  Ecological restoration is completely consistent with carbon protection, 
and, as Tom said, we cannot afford to lose any of these natural areas that 
store carbon.  The goal is not to lose the carbon already stored, but how to 
figure out how to store millions more.  The one way to do it is to allow our 
trees to grow, maintaining a no-net loss just as sacrificing our single biggest 
opportunity to do something important about climate change right now. 
 
 
Thank you. 
 
 
(audience applause) 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Thank you very much for your comments. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  Senator, may I just say one thing-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Sure. 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  --just to indulge us. 
 
 
People expected that there may be public comment, but because 
of time there isn’t.  A lot of people traveled very far to come here to show 
their support-- 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Right-- 
 
 
MR. RUGA:  --for us.  I would just like them -- if it’s OK with 
you -- if they stand? 
 
 
And, these represent organizations as well as individuals. 
 
 
 
71 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  By the way, we thank them for coming; we 
thank them for their participation in the Task Force; and, I don’t know if you 
heard the earlier comment -- I don’t have a microphone that works -- will you 
turn off your microphones?  Maybe that’s the problem.  Let me try this. 
 
 
Yes, that’s the problem. 
 
 
So, we can’t thank you enough for all of the time and effort that 
you’ve put into -- and, not necessarily agreeing with the Task Force 
recommendations, but being part of the process, making sure that people are 
aware of all of the issues.  Your issues are legitimate issues.  We’re going to 
look at all of them. 
 
 
And, you may not have heard the first comment that we made, 
which is, we know we’re in a tough time frame here.  The record is -- there’s 
a stenographic record being taken, and there is also three weeks from today -
- today is the 22nd of February -- it’s three weeks where we’d love to get more 
comments from anybody.  Emails, cards, letters -- whatever you want.  
Because, it’s a huge topic, and we want to make sure that we’ve gotten 
everybody’s point of view. 
 
 
But, the flipside of that is, there’s only so much abuse we can do 
to our representatives, and we still have two more groups that are coming out.  
 
 
So, let me suggest that -- don’t be afraid to send in your cards 
and letters.  In fact, I think you have, but--  And, then, one other thing.  If 
you take a look at the 270 pages, every group’s position and representative is 
on a page, which I think -- and, especially if there’s somebody there who 
wasn’t in the report, and the position is misstated, please make sure you 
correct it. 
 
 
 
72 
 
 
So, thank you for your time and effort today.  I think our next 
speaker is Jaclyn Rhoads from Pinelands Preservation. 
 
 
MS. SAUER:  Thank you. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Thank you very much. 
 
 
DR. WEBB:  Thank you all. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Is Jackie Rhoads here? 
J A C L Y N   R H O A D S,  Ph.D.:  I am here. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  You are here?  Oh, there you are. 
 
 
DR. RHOADS:  And, don’t worry, I don’t plan to take 15 
minutes.  I am eager -- well, I have somewhere else to be as well. 
 
 
But, I am Jaclyn Rhoads, I am the Assistant Executive Director 
of Pinelands Preservation Alliance. 
 
 
Simply, we are the watchdog organization for the Pinelands 
National Reserve, which is about 1.1 million acres.  Pinelands represents 
nearly 25% of the land area in New Jersey, and contains close to -- not more 
than -- a third of the open space in the state as well.  So, obviously, forest 
stewardship, forest management, is absolutely critical to the livelihood of the 
Pinelands.   
 
 
I want to first say a thank you to the Task Force chairs.  
Obviously, they spent countless weeks on this, besides just being in the 
meetings but understanding, just from my perspective, being involved in this 
issue for many, many years, all the work it took to listen, gather information, 
obviously manage the various opinions of hundreds of people.  It was 
definitely hard, but also a very important task. 
 
 
And, thank you to everyone here sitting today who are listening; 
who are traveling far; and, of course, the legislators for taking the time. 
 
 
 
73 
 
 
And, of course, to you, Senator Smith, for being the leader of this 
issue for many, many years.  I don’t know if you recall, but I’ve been with 
PPA now for 19 years.  I came to you when we first were working on the 
Prescribed Burn Bill asking you to be a sponsor.  You said no at the time, but 
that’s OK, because you had said, “I have someone else for you.”  Ultimately, 
the bill was passed and signed into law in 2018.  And, that is an important 
element of forest stewardship in the Pinelands, is prescribed burning. 
 
 
I’ve heard a number of comments, obviously, to the 
recommendations before you today.  Number 9 and Number 12 highlight the 
variation in the state -- Pinelands obviously being one of them.  Also, 
highlighting the need for fire as an important tool for forest stewardship.  
That is why we pushed for that act, we recognize the importance of that tool; 
we recognize that fire, although emits carbon into the atmosphere, it also can 
sequester a lot of carbon after the fact in terms of regeneration.  So, I just 
wanted to highlight that, because thinning is an important element of setting 
a prescribed fire, but in no way can replicate the need for fire and for allowing, 
in some cases, some wildfire that can be contained to occur, because of the 
ecological benefits associated with it.  Of course, recognizing we want to 
protect residential communities and the like; that we want to have a system 
in place that has done so safely. 
 
 
So, with that said, there are a couple of other highlights I wanted 
to mention, one being Recommendation Number 1 -- the inventory and 
planning.  That was a recommendation of our organization as well as several 
others that presented proposals for the Task Force meetings.  And, that is 
key.  I think a lot of the debate, a lot of the concerns that exist around forestry 
in New Jersey, is because of individual proposals that were presented over the 
 
 
 
74 
years that lacked a little bit of public outreach that seemed to have very 
specific goals that didn’t necessarily take into account -- or, at least, appeared 
to not take into account -- the entire ecosystem.  With inventory, with 
planning, we can really address a lot of those concerns, and, also, have that 
plan forward that looks at climate change; that looks at ecosystem 
management; that looks at protecting our water resources by managing those 
forests in a (indiscernible) and ecosystem perspective way.  So, that is 
absolutely key. 
 
 
I also would like to highlight that I’m wearing a sticker here 
today.  We did support the recommendations, but we also recognize that, as 
Eliott said and other people that did not sign onto the framework, there are 
still some issues to work through.  The devil is in the details for some of these 
issues.  And, although we have a lot of consensus in the room today regarding 
most of the recommendations, there is still some work to be done.  You know, 
the work on, what does it mean to have ecological purpose for the sale and 
extraction of wood?  We feel the same way.  I mean, there are going to be 
proposals.  There was one recently, Bass River State Forest, that received a 
lot of opposition.  In the end, Pinelands Preservation Alliance supported it 
because we recognize it as a tool, as a need for thinning in order to protect 
communities from wildfires, but also to allow for prescribed fires to happen. 
 
 
There are going to be those instances; there are going to be time 
spent on defining these things, still, as we move forward.  But overall, again, 
we support the recommendations.  We recognize that the need for writing a 
check, coming up with that amount, is absolutely critical, and it feeds into a 
campaign that, actually, many of our groups are involved in right now called 
 
 
 
75 
(indiscernible), where we need more resources devoted to our State parks and 
forests. 
 
 
We spent a lot of money on acquiring that land, which is 
phenomenal; we obviously have a lot of open space in New Jersey.  But, we 
tend to fail in terms of the resources devoted to maintaining it, both from 
forest management but as well as those recreation areas.  And, I think a lot 
of these things are coming together as we realize how much importance needs 
to come down to those resources and money that we need for it. 
 
 
So, thank you all, I’m happy to answer questions. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Thank you, Jackie. 
 
 
Any questions?  (no response) 
 
 
All right, then our last witness today -- last group -- is Eric Olsen, 
Director of Conservation Programs, The Nature Conservancy, New Jersey 
Chapter.  Mr. Olsen, are you here? 
 
 
Take it away. 
E R I C   O L S E N:  Thank you. 
 
 
Good 
afternoon, 
Chairmen 
Smith 
and 
Kennedy, 
and 
distinguished members of the Committee. 
 
 
I have the coveted ending speaking spot here.  My name is Eric 
Olsen, I am the Conservation -- the Director of Conservation Programs for 
the New Jersey Chapter of The Nature Conservancy. 
 
 
And, on behalf of TNC, I applaud the Chairman -- Chairmen -- 
and legislative members here today for holding this hearing and digging into 
this very important topic. 
 
 
TNC is one of the leading conservation organizations in the 
world, with a presence in all 50 states, and over 70 countries worldwide.  Our 
 
 
 
76 
mission is to conserve the land and waters on which all life depends by 
working in a collaborative, science-based manner with a variety of partners.  
Here in New Jersey, TNC has helped to preserve over 60,000 acres of open 
space; removed dams and restored more than 30 miles of river habitat; 
planted more than 100,000 trees across the state; and restored hundreds of 
acres of coastal marsh habitat by thin-spreading sediment to promote growth.  
They also promote state and local levels, the use of nature-based solutions to 
reduce the impacts of climate change.  TNC currently owns and manages 
more than 22,000 acres in 23 nature preserves throughout the State of New 
Jersey.  We are actively dealing with many of the threats to the health of our 
forests on a daily basis -- many of the items that were brought up today. 
 
 
And, our state has often lagged behind others to enact many of 
the priorities that have been identified in this report.  Issues like regulating 
invasive species and scientifically designed deer management are two such 
examples.  So, we feel this is bringing us to current times.  And, we feel that 
the recommendations made by the Forest Task Force outline strong actions 
that would make significant contributions for the health and well-being of 
the state’s forest lands and the biodiversity that depends upon those forests.  
Especially in the face of a changing climate. 
 
 
They 
were 
not 
deeply 
involved 
in 
developing 
these 
recommendations, but I wanted to emphasize and highlight three important 
aspects of the recommendations that secured our support.  The first, which 
was mentioned a lot today, was the emphasis on science, design, planning.  
We support those recommendations to conduct a statewide mapping and 
data-collection process, and that inventory of mapping take place on a routine 
basis to develop a robust database over time. 
 
 
 
77 
 
 
We recommend the inclusion of urban forestlands in this 
inventory process, as they are net positives for nature and people in our fight 
against climate change.  Science-driven management, planning, and 
implementation is a hallmark of our organization.  We are regularly collecting 
on-the-ground data, and use that data to develop a sound plan; we act; and 
then monitor and learn from the results of our actions.  To do this well, it 
will take consistent State investment in collecting robust data, and evaluating 
the impacts of actions taken.  This is a recurring gap in natural lands 
management in our state, and we do not often have enough capacity -- as has 
been a pretty consistent theme today -- in the state agencies to conduct 
adequate management, nor to monitor the results of actions taken.  
Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the recommendation to secure, find, 
and/or create sustainable funding to implement these recommendations. 
 
 
Our second point of support is for the recommendations related 
to climate change, forest protection, and management to store carbon.  
Climate change is altering the world as we know it, no matter how quickly 
we act to reduce our carbon footprint.  Permanently protecting forests and 
allowing them to grow old has proven to be one of the most effective and 
cost-efficient methods available to address the climate crisis. 
 
 
We 
support 
the 
recommendations 
that 
encourage 
the 
designation of important carbon reserves and the continued protection of 
forests, important for carbon sequestration, as well as the recommendations 
to identify areas on state lands for forest restoration and afforestation efforts.  
Each of these efforts as has been outlined really is critical to achieving the 
ambitious goals set out in the 80 by 50 Framework.  And, one of the cheapest 
ways to reforest our forests is to let nature do it.  Talking about cost cutting 
 
 
 
78 
-- let nature do it themselves.  And, that’s another reason why we should be 
managing our deer populations. 
 
 
So, our final point of support is that we felt these 
recommendations provided a sound, reasonable set of compromises across 
the interests in the environmental community regarding forest management.  
This was not an easy assignment that was given to those.  I commend the 
organizations that led and participated in this process.  I know not every 
organization will support these recommendations, but we are confident that 
the recommendations addressed the main interests and concerns that have 
been raised, and offer sound steps to address items like public participation 
and (indiscernible).   
 
 
We found the recommendation to be both holistic and 
comprehensive.  If these recommendations are implemented, we’re confident 
the resulting processes would involve robust stakeholder input to allow a 
customized approach for each region in which a planning process is designed.  
A lot of these management plans are case-by-case basis -- inventory on a place, 
and a management plan designed for that specific place.  And, this is 
important to ensure that a diversity of thoughts is heard relative to the region 
and issues of concern.  We want to underscore the importance for including 
indigenous people and traditional ecological knowledge among other 
stakeholder groups in these processes.  
 
 
And, as we all continue to build a stronger, more resilient 
ecologically thriving state, we must ensure that we make smart, science-based 
decisions that benefit nature and our residents.  Forests play a critical role in 
supporting the health of our communities, and our natural resources.  We 
 
 
 
79 
owe it to the future generations to be able to work together to safeguard New 
Jersey’s people and its biodiversity. 
 
 
I am happy to take any questions you may have. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN KENNEDY:  I have a question from 
Assemblyman Stanley. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  Yes, thank you, Chairman. 
 
 
I just wanted to see if one of the Co-Chairs can come back up 
here. 
 
 
I hear the terminology “ecological health.”  So, I would like to 
know how the term derived, under what terms are they used, and is it a 
scientific-based term, or is it a -- how is it brought up? 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Mr. Olsen, please stay here. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, we have a glossary of terms. 
 
 
I am going to read some definitions that are in our glossary, but 
I also want to expand on the context of what you heard for ecological health 
in relation to Sparta Mountain, because I think that that’s why you’re asking 
the question.  But, let me just read from our glossary, I have it up here. 
 
 
So, we thought it was important to define some terms because 
we were hearing them a lot and they were contentious -- ecological health was 
one of them.  So, we selected several different sources, several different 
professional organizations -- respected scientific organizations -- and that 
defined terms in forest ecology. 
 
 
The International -- the IPPC, the International Climate Change 
that Professor Moomaw is involved in defines ecological health as, “A 
metaphor used to describe the condition of an ecosystem by analogy with 
human health.  Note that there is no universally accepted benchmark for a 
 
 
 
80 
healthy ecosystem; rather, the apparent health status of an ecosystem is 
judged on the ecosystem’s all 2907 glossary (indiscernible) to change,” that’s 
a very specific definition, “With details depending upon which metrics are 
employed and judging it in which societal aspirations are driving the 
assessment.” 
 
 
Also, “ecosystem function,” which is related:  “The major 
processes of ecosystems that regulate or influence the structure, composition, 
and pattern.  These include the nutrient cycle; energy flows; trophic levels; 
food-chain diversity patterns; development and evolution; cybernetics; 
hydrologic cycle; and weathering processes.” 
 
 
And, finally, “ecological restoration” is, “The process of assisting 
the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.”  
So, there’s lots of different definitions. 
 
 
In the context of Sparta Mountain, the ecological health goal 
there is to create habitat for bird species -- primarily bird species.  This is the 
New Jersey DEP goal for the Sparta Mountain Management Plan.  That is an 
ecological goal; it’s to provide habitat for bird species, for animal species.  
That is not an acceptable reason for some people to manage a parcel of land.  
It’s still -- the goal is ecological health at Sparta Mountain. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  So, is this terminology being used 
currently when assessing issues in New Jersey? 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, more specifically.  So, if you have a forest-
management plan, you need to define your goals.  And, they go deeper than 
“ecological health.”  For instance, in the Sparta Mountain, it is defined that 
its habitat creation for species of birds.  So, they get into more specifics. 
 
 
 
81 
 
 
But, overall, in discussing an ecological health goal, that’s an 
umbrella term for habitat creation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration -- those 
are all within the umbrella term of “ecological health.” 
 
 
And, I didn’t notice Tom came up.  (laughter) 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  I just want to add that we understand there’s 
some concern out there about the fact that ecological health is not clearly 
defined or easy to define.  And, we get that. 
 
 
We felt like this was not the appropriate forum for us to try to 
resolve that issue, and that’s why we recommended the creation of a scientific 
advisory council and a science-based plan in process as the appropriate forum 
to have that conversation, and have that council composed of scientific 
experts across various disciplines that would look at the data and would assess 
what should be the appropriate ecological objectives and concerns in our 
public forest lands based on the data, and to have that comprehensive 
planning process with public input so that the public can fully be a part of 
that and comment on, suggest what those ecological objectives should or 
should not be -- a comment comes out of that process. 
 
 
But, we very intentionally felt like that’s the place to resolve that 
issue that we couldn’t resolve; we would not have been able to resolve and 
come to an agreement on how to define ecological health or not define the 
Task Force. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  OK, one more question. 
 
 
According to your Recommendation Number 15, is that 
ecological health a formal definition or a narrow definition of what it is you’re 
recommending for these (indiscernible) trees? 
 
 
 
82 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  For some ecological end points -- some 
ecological goals -- the cutting of trees can be a management tool.  If, in those 
instances where you are cutting a tree for your ecologically health-derived 
management goal, you can either leave the wood onsite or you can remove 
the wood.  In some instances, it’s best to leave the wood if you want to create 
different kinds of habitat.  And, in some instances, the wood is removed. 
 
 
And, what we’re seeing here is that in instances where wood can 
be removed after cutting, yes, you may as well sell it rather than put it in a 
landfill or otherwise put it in a place where the carbon might be released -- 
yeah, be released. 
 
 
So, it’s a multi-step process, beginning with the tool that you 
used for the management plan. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  So, in essence, it is a narrow 
definition? 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Yes, simply put. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  OK, thank you. 
 
 
Thank you, Chairman. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Chairman, I have a question. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Senator, go ahead. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  With all this discussion, I hadn’t heard any 
topic brought around with the increased building in the state.  That poses an 
effect, too, when we have increased population -- our population continues 
to grow in this state; we have manufacturers building warehouses, tearing 
down forestry. 
 
 
 
83 
 
 
Where do you fall in that regard?  Is this something that--  I 
mean, clearly, we’re not going to impose upon private lands; private lands is 
private lands.  But, public lands may be restricting that aspect? 
 
 
MS. RAMOS-BUSOT:  Thank you, Senator, for that question. 
 
 
I would like to start with the private land part.  It is a threat in 
those --  we have a development problem here in New Jersey because they say 
we are the most densely populated state.  And, so, that is a threat to forests 
and open space in New Jersey -- more so than public lands, if you really look 
at it in terms of numbers. 
 
 
But, unfortunately, it’s a much-complicated mechanism to tell 
private owners what to do with their land or not.  Therefore, that’s why would 
focus on public lands, so the magnitude that private land has on our forests 
and any open spaces and that they can be larger. 
 
 
When it comes to public lands, I think that development is 
something that is much more complicated, and I don’t think I can answer 
that question, but, Tom-- 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  I’ll try to answer it. 
 
 
So, again, our focus was not on private lands, but, as I noted 
earlier, that the DEP’s Global Warming Response Act 80 by 50 Report is 
counting on maintaining the over 8 million metric tons of carbon stored 
across various land types, and increasing that by 33%.  We’re not going to 
hold onto that 8.1 million metric tons of carbon if we continue to lose large 
amounts of forested and other natural lands, and that’s where New Jersey’s 
very successful preservation programs need to continue. 
 
 
The work is not done; New Jersey has been at it for decades, has 
been very successful, but we need to continue to fund our Green Acres 
 
 
 
84 
program, our farmland-preservation program, to purchase lands from willing 
sellers.  When a landowner wants to sell their property for preservation and 
that’s a win for the landowner and it’s a win for the public, and the work is 
not done.  There’s still hundreds of thousands of acres, of high-value open 
space, forested, agricultural wetlands; lands throughout the state that still 
need to be preserved. 
 
 
SENATOR DURR:  Well, yeah, I agree.  I think we should more 
incentivize the purchase of these and preserve the lands.  I think that’s where 
we fall short. 
 
 
Thank you. 
 
 
MR. GILBERT:  I agree. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  So, one last question for Mr. Olsen. 
 
 
You’ve indicated here in the business of preserving land and 
forests, etc.  Any suggestion on the deer problem? 
 
 
MR. OLSEN:  We hunt all of our lands.  I think a lot of the 
recommendations that were made in this report are worthy to discuss.  We’re 
losing hunters generation by generation.  We’ve seen success when we’ve 
created rules on our lands, where we encouraged the removal of does, of 
female deer from the herd, and that’s when we see the most significant deer 
reductions on -- we do the aerial surveys over our preserves where we’re 
actively -- we make a plan, we act, and now we’re measuring the impact.  And, 
we’ve seen deer herds slash in half just by implementing more aggressive doe 
hunting. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Thank you. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  Oh, can I mention one thing on deer?

We mentioned Chief Mann earlier, and he proposed -- he has 
some interesting ideas about handling deer populations based on the 
indigenous populations, the stewarding of land.  And, in fact, New Jersey 
Audubon is coordinating with Chief Mann and his tribe to control deer on 
some of our lands. 
 
 
So, we’re eager to see how successful that is, and we’ll share the 
results. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  If the Chief has any secrets, we’d really like 
to hear them. 
 
 
DR. MURPHY:  He’s happy to talk about them, so I’ll let him. 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN KENNEDY:  Is there any other questions 
from members? 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  Chairman, are we OK? 
 
 
ASSEMBLYMAN KENNEDY:  We’re fine. 
 
 
SENATOR SMITH:  OK, meeting is adjourned. 
 
 
Thank you all for your participation.
