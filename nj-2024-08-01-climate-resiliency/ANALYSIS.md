**Page Start:** 32  
**Claims Made:** 12  
**Testimony Submitted:** Yes (Appendix)

#### Temperature Claims

> "Global temperature has risen approximately 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, rising more rapidly in recent decades."
> — Page 32

> "In New Jersey, average annual temperatures have risen by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century — so, roughly twice as fast as the global average."
> — Page 33

> "Of the 20 warmest years since 1895, when records began, 15 of them have occurred since 2020, including 2023 — which, for New Jersey, was the third-warmest year on record."
> — Pages 33-34

> "unusually warm months have been much more prevalent than unusually cold months — outnumbering them 48 to 0 since 1990."
> — Page 33

#### Sea-Level Rise Claims

> "In Atlantic City, sea-levels have risen by more than 18 inches since records began in 1911."
> — Pages 34-35

> "During the 1950s, that kind of sunny-day flooding in Atlantic City averaged less than one day per year, but that rate had increased to about eight days per year in the decade ending in 2016."
> — Page 35

> "by 2030 sea-level is expected to rise between 0.5 and 1.1 feet relative to the 1991 to 2009 baseline, and 0.9 to 2.1 feet by 2050... In a moderate emissions scenario, the likely range of sea-level rise in 2100 is expected to be 2.0 to 5.1 feet."
> — Page 35

> "By 2050, sunny-day or nuisance flooding in Atlantic City is projected to occur at least 85 times per year, even with moderate greenhouse gas emissions."
> — Page 35

#### Hurricane Sandy Attribution

> "some of my colleagues at Rutgers have estimated that the rise in sea level since 1880 caused about 38,000 more people in New Jersey to be affected by Hurricane Sandy's floodwaters."
> — Page 36

#### Precipitation Claims

> "In the northeastern United States, including New Jersey, the number of days on which precipitation of 2 inches or more occurs has increased by 49% since 1958."
> — Page 34

### Dr. Ning Lin (Princeton University)
**Credentials:** Ph.D., Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering  
**Page Start:** 39  
**Claims Made:** 3  
**Special Expertise:** Hurricane storm surge modeling

#### Storm Surge Projections (2012 Nature Climate Change paper)

> "storm-climatology change and sea-level rise would make the storm-surge flooding risk for this region, specifically New York City, 100-year flood level to occur every three to 20 years, by the end of the century, and a 500-year flood level to occur every 25 to 240 years by the end of the century."
> — Pages 40-41

*Note: This paper was published February 2012, months before Hurricane Sandy validated its projections.*

#### Compound Hazards

> "nine out of 10 largest blackouts in the United States — caused by hurricanes."
> — Page 43

> "What happens if we have heat waves when we lost the power and air conditioning? So, this so-called 'hurricane blackout heatwave compound hazards' are emerging."
> — Page 43

### Dr. Thomas Herrington (American Shore and Beach Preservation Association)
**Credentials:** Ph.D.; Associate Director, Urban Coast Institute, Monmouth University  
**Page Start:** 56  
**Claims Made:** 3

#### Beach Nourishment Effectiveness

> "the U.S. Army Corps determined that beach nourishment projects in New York and New Jersey saved an estimated $1.3 billion in avoided damages."
> — Page 57 (referring to Hurricane Sandy)

#### Economic Impact

> "According to the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, tourism in New Jersey generates over $49 billion in revenue annually, and $29 billion is attributed to the coastal counties."
> — Page 58

## Government Witness Claims

### Nick Angarone (DEP Chief Resilience Officer)

> "as of 2019, New Jersey ranked third in the nation in claims paid by FEMA since 1978... with $5.8 billion in total flood insurance claims."

> "over 30% of claims from Ida originating outside of FEMA's designated flood plains."
> — Page 5

> "It is likely that sea-level rise will meet or exceed 2.1 feet by 2050."
> — Page 7

> "a 50% chance that Atlantic City will experience flooding almost every day by 2100."
> — Page 7

> "New Jersey is the third-fastest warming state in the nation."
> — Page 11

### Lt. Dinan Amin (State Hazard Mitigation Officer)

> "Recently, New Jersey's experienced uncommon hazards such as a 1,000-year, six-hour rainfall total, and an Enhanced Fujita Scale EF3 tornado."
> — Page 27

> "New Jersey's coastal economy generates over $60 billion per year."
> — Pages 27-28

> "The Mitigation Unit has obtained more than $1.1 billion in Federal funding since Hurricane Sandy."

## Research Institution Claims

### Kimberly McKenna (Stockton University Coastal Research Center)

> "From the tide-gauge records at Sandy Hook and Atlantic City, relative sea level has risen about a half a foot since we started collecting data in 1986."
> — Page 52

> "Hurricane Sandy's losses at the New Jersey Beach Profile Network locations were significant. We saw... losses of 14 million cubic yards of sediment just at our sites that we had monitored."
> — Page 52

> "beaches with Federally designed coastal risk-reduction projects — those are the beach nourishment that have the engineered dunes — these were extremely effective in protecting infrastructure and homes, mostly due to the wide beaches and the high dunes that were created in excess of 20 feet."
> — Page 52

### Lisa Auermuller (Rutgers MACH Consortium)

> "5 feet of permanent inundation would mean... more than 123,000 residential properties and about $27 billion in property value."
> — Pages 47-48

## Legislative Outcomes and Policy Connections

### Primary Policy Focus: NJ PACT REAL Rules

The hearing centered on the pending Resilient Environments and Landscapes (REAL) rule proposal—a 1,000+ page regulatory update. Key provisions informed by scientific testimony:

| REAL Provision | Supporting Scientific Claim | Speaker |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------|
| 5 feet sea-level rise standard | "2.0 to 5.1 feet by 2100" | Dr. Broccoli |
| Climate-adjusted flood elevation | "30% of Ida claims outside FEMA zones" | Angarone |
| Inundation risk zone | "123,000 properties at 5ft inundation" | Auermuller |
| Nature-based solutions emphasis | "$1.3B saved by beach nourishment" | Dr. Herrington |

### Legislative Items Discussed

| Item | Type | Status | Key Witness |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| NJ PACT REAL Rules | Pending regulation | Under development | Multiple |
| Inland Flood Protection Rule | Existing law | Adopted 2023 | Angarone |
| Flood Disclosure Law | Existing law | Active | Angarone/Smith |
| Blue Acres Program | Active program | 1,100+ buyouts | Angarone/Amin |
| Shore Protection Fund | Existing (1992) | $25M/year | Dr. Herrington |
| Stormwater Utilities | Available tool | 1 NJ municipality | Sen. Smith |
| NOAA Award ($72M) | New funding | July 2024 | Angarone |

### Recommendations Made

1. **Statewide Bond Issue** (Sen. Smith) — Dedicated funding for flood mitigation
2. **Water Infrastructure Center** (Kasabach, referencing Sen. Greenstein's bill)
3. **Climate Adaptation Targets** (Kasabach) — Similar to GHG reduction targets
4. **Managed Retreat Tools** (Sigmund-Massih) — Expand Blue Acres, local studies
5. **Shore Protection Fund Increase** (Dr. Herrington) — To $50M/year

## Committee Engagement Analysis

### Questions Directed to Witnesses

| Witness | Questions Received | Topics |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Nick Angarone | 3 | Sea level certainty, PACT progress, property impacts |
| Dr. Broccoli | 2 | Practical adaptation, shore guidance |
| Dr. Lin | 1 | State agency coordination |
| Kimberly McKenna | 2 | Priorities, engineered dunes |
| Tim Dillingham | 2 | Development obligations, horseshoe crabs |
| Peter Kasabach | 1 | Affordable housing |

### Notable Q&A Exchanges

**Assemblyman Inganamort to Angarone (p. 21):**
> "I have to ask the question: What level of certainty do you have — what level of probability, from a statistical sense — in these projections?"

*Angarone deferred to scientists, explaining "likely range" methodology and why policy should not be based on a "coin flip."*

**Senator Smith to Dr. Broccoli (p. 38):**
> "How much trouble are we in?"

*Broccoli provided measured response: adaptation is necessary regardless of emissions policy because "there is more climate change in the pipeline."*

## Lessons for Effective Scientific Testimony

### What Worked Well

1. **NJ-Specific Data** — Witnesses led with local findings (Atlantic City, Sandy Hook) before national context
2. **Quantified Uncertainty** — "likely range," "two-in-three chance" framing respected by legislators
3. **Economic Framing** — $5.8B FEMA claims, $1.3B Sandy savings, $27B property exposure
4. **Institutional Credibility** — Rutgers, Princeton, Stockton research centers provided trusted sources
5. **Living Proof** — Hurricane Sandy served as undeniable validation of projections
6. **Coordinated Testimony** — Multiple witnesses reinforced same 2.1ft/5.1ft projections

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Unified Document** — No single summary brief for legislators
2. **Visual Aids** — Senator Smith displayed NOAA maps; others noted FloodMapper not shown
3. **Follow-Up Protocol** — Several "send us that information" requests required tracking
4. **Counter-Narrative Preparation** — Limited direct engagement with property value concerns
