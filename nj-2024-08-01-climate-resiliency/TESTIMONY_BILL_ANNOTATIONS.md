## Dr. Anthony Broccoli (Rutgers) — Climate Science

### Testimony Claim 1: Sea Level Rise Projections

**Quote (p.12):**
> "By 2050, we're looking at about 2.1 feet of sea level rise under moderate scenarios... By 2100, potentially 5.1 feet or more under high emissions scenarios."

**Bills Addressing This:** 

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A2324** | Requires hazard mitigation plans to include climate change-related threat assessments | Withdrawn | 📋 PENDING |
| **S1530** | Requires hazard mitigation plans to include climate change threat assessments | In committee | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** While no bills specifically reference the 2.1ft/5.1ft projections, hazard mitigation plan requirements would incorporate such science. The specific projections from Dr. Broccoli's testimony aren't codified numerically in any bill.

**Match Quality:** INDIRECT — Bills require climate assessment but don't mandate specific projections.

**Gap:** Legislation should reference Rutgers Scientific Panel projections explicitly for planning purposes.

---

### Testimony Claim 2: Temperature Extremes

**Quote (p.14):**
> "We're seeing more frequent and intense heat waves... The number of days above 90°F has increased significantly."

**Bills Addressing This:**

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A1461** | Establishes Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Financing Program | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **S345** | Establishes Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Charge Program | In committee | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** Climate financing bills exist but don't specifically address heat resilience. Urban heat island mitigation is not directly addressed.

**Match Quality:** LOW — Bills address climate broadly but not heat-specific adaptations.

---

## Dr. Ning Lin (Princeton) — Storm Surge Modeling

### Testimony Claim 3: Compound Flood Risk

**Quote (p.22):**
> "Storm surge combined with sea level rise creates compound flood risk... A Sandy-level storm in 2050 would have significantly worse impacts due to baseline sea level rise."

**Bills Addressing This:**

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A427** | Requires DEP and reservoir owners to implement flood control measures | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **S2107** | Requires DEP and reservoir owners to implement flood control measures | In committee | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** Flood control bills exist but focus on inland reservoir flooding, not coastal storm surge compound risk. Dr. Lin's specific coastal compound flood modeling isn't reflected in current legislation.

**Match Quality:** LOW — Bills address flooding but not the specific compound coastal risk.

---

### Testimony Claim 4: Property Risk Disclosure

**Quote (p.28):**
> "Homebuyers often don't know the flood history or future risk of properties they're purchasing... Disclosure requirements could help."

**Bills Addressing This:**

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A789** | Requires insurers that sell flood insurance to provide certain policyholders with information | In committee | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** Only one tangentially related bill found — it requires INSURERS to provide information, not sellers/buyers in real estate transactions. Dr. Lin's recommendation for real estate disclosure isn't addressed.

**Match Quality:** LOW — Insurance disclosure ≠ real estate transaction disclosure.

---

## Dr. Thomas Herrington (Monmouth/ASBPA) — Coastal Engineering

### Testimony Claim 5: Beach Nourishment Effectiveness

**Quote (p.35):**
> "The beach nourishment projects completed before Sandy saved an estimated $1.3 billion in damages... The return on investment for coastal protection is substantial."

**Bills Addressing This:**

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A3056** | Revises permitting thresholds for coastal development (CAFRA) | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **S1342** | Revises permitting thresholds for coastal development | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **A5298** | Requires DEP and NJ Infrastructure Bank to prioritize coastal resilience projects | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **S4091** | Requires DEP and NJ Infrastructure Bank to prioritize coastal resilience | In committee | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** Multiple bills address coastal protection infrastructure. A5298/S4091 specifically prioritize resilience projects, which aligns with Dr. Herrington's testimony about ROI on coastal protection.

**Match Quality:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Bills support continued coastal protection investment, though don't specifically reference the $1.3B Sandy savings figure.

---

### Testimony Claim 6: Blue Acres / Managed Retreat

**Quote (p.41):**
> "Some areas simply cannot be protected cost-effectively... Buyout programs like Blue Acres have been successful in removing homes from the most vulnerable areas."

**Bills Addressing This:**

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A2104** | Requires DEP to prioritize funding for projects that include flood mitigation | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **S1474** | Requires DEP to prioritize funding for flood mitigation projects | In committee | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** Bills exist for flood mitigation funding priority but don't specifically expand Blue Acres. The managed retreat/buyout concept isn't directly legislated in the current session.

**Match Quality:** LOW — General flood mitigation ≠ specific Blue Acres expansion.

**Gap:** No legislation proposes Blue Acres program expansion despite testimony support.

## Cross-Witness Themes

### Theme 7: Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Standards

**Multiple witnesses** emphasized updating building codes and infrastructure standards for climate resilience.

**Bills Addressing This:**

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A633** | Requires electric utilities to implement flood mitigation plans for substations | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **A1461** | Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Financing Program | In committee | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** Some infrastructure resilience bills exist but comprehensive building code updates for climate aren't addressed.

**Match Quality:** PARTIAL — Sector-specific (utilities) but no comprehensive infrastructure standards.

---

### Theme 8: Climate Adaptation Financing

**Multiple witnesses** emphasized the need for dedicated funding.

**Bills Addressing This:**

| Bill | Synopsis | Status | Alignment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A1461** | Establishes Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Financing Program in NJ Infrastructure Bank | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **S345** | Establishes Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Charge Program | In committee | 📋 PENDING |
| **A2103** | Establishes Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Charge Program | Withdrawn | 📋 PENDING |

**Annotation:** Climate financing bills exist and align well with testimony recommendations. This is one of the strongest testimony-to-legislation connections.

**Match Quality:** HIGH — Multiple bills directly address climate financing as recommended.

## Quantitative Summary

### Testimony → Legislation Adoption Rates

| Witness | Claims Analyzed | Bills Addressing | Bills Enacted | Success Rate |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Dr. Broccoli | 2 | 4 | 0 | 0% enacted |
| Dr. Lin | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0% enacted |
| Dr. Herrington | 2 | 4 | 0 | 0% enacted |
| Multiple (cross-theme) | 2 | 5 | 0 | 0% enacted |

### Overall Hearing Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total testimony themes | 8 |
| Themes with supporting bills | 4 (50%) |
| Themes with enacted legislation | 0 (0%) |
| Themes facing active opposition | 0 (0%) |
| Themes with high match quality | 2 (25%) |
| Themes inadequately addressed | 4 (50%) |

### Key Findings

1. **Better reception than plastic hearing** — No opposition bills found that contradict climate testimony (unlike plastic hearing where repeal efforts are active).

2. **Financing is the strongest link** — Climate adaptation financing bills (A1461, S345) most closely match testimony recommendations.

3. **Specific projections not codified** — While Dr. Broccoli provided specific sea level numbers (2.1ft/5.1ft), no bill mandates using these projections for planning.

4. **Blue Acres gap** — Despite multiple witnesses supporting managed retreat, no legislation proposes expanding the Blue Acres buyout program.

5. **Disclosure gap** — Dr. Lin's property risk disclosure recommendation has no corresponding real estate legislation.

## Recommendations for Future Testimony

Based on analysis of what did/didn't translate to legislation:

1. **Tie to existing bill numbers** — Reference specific pending bills by number
2. **Propose specific dollar figures** — Budget implications help advance bills
3. **Provide draft language** — Witnesses could offer suggested statutory text
4. **Follow up with sponsors** — Post-hearing engagement with bill sponsors
